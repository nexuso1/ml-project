It's not big balla like most of you. But it's honest work. \n\n[Fuel for my Fiat fund. You will be missed GT40 fund. \\(https:\\\/\\\/www.shelby.com\\\/Vehicles\\\/GT40-Shelby-Edition\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4pn9lgofb8w71.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1846b3e6ffd00764b100df5cd0a2ee62190d87c)\n\n**Look at these freaking crayons.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gamestop narrowing its price action to the middle. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r4xgne33a8w71.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff6686f527e36fdf9eb1bb445a272e3cbd39fcd)\n\n**Large Chart Crayons:** The price went bananas in January. It didn't crap itself to the bottom like every other high IV stock out there. It just kind of squeezed to the middle with no real action overall. Theta gang had happy times here. But ... theta gang happiness also means there's consolidation in the waters. Consolidation in the waters means there's room for upswing (or downswing), but prob not much sideways trading for much longer.  GME went from \ud83d\ude36 to \ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6 to \ud83d\udca5 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\ude10 back to \ud83d\ude80 and then  \ud83d\ude10\/\ud83d\ude36 ever since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other notable crayons:** \n\nMoney flow is increasing. That's a good thing especially when you see consolidation in the waters. \n\nBad signs I see are that it's GME and everyone hates on it these days + the selloffs in the past few months mean that we're not at the precipice of \ud83d\ude80 or \ud83d\udca6 tomorrow, but so likely by ... hopefully November 19th (..cough..cough). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: \u23f3..\ud83d\udd1c..**\ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6",
        "1":"Like a lot of you I lost quite a lot of money on GME during the craze earlier in the year.  I then lost even more playing with GME options over time and stopped touching it around May (I think).\n\nAnyway, after I saw it spike a few times, and maintain a much higher price than it was at right before and after January, I started looking at it again.  I noticed that it seems like it spikes once every 2-3 months.  Obviously something happening 3 times isn't proof that it's going to keep happening, and nothing is for sure in the market of course... but I'm wondering what all of you Wendy's cashiers think.  Is there a reason it seems to run a cycle?\n\nDaily chart: https:\/\/ibb.co\/NpXQgxF",
        "2":"In this post we're going to check on all of our favorite meme stonks and see if they've got anything left in the tank from a technical analysis standpoint. Come one and come all and hear my tale, whether you're a distraught bagholder ape or someone looking to get in on what I believe may be the final moonshot. Not a financial advisor blah blah blah you know the thing.\n\nFirst off, none of these plays work without Meme Stonk Frenzy Round 3. We had Round 1 late January with GME being the big runner, round 2 early June with AMC melting faces, and while this doesn't make Round 3 a sure thing, I'd like to think retail isn't dead, the shorts haven't covered, and with Tesla being overbought as hell and the Trump Pump near a conclusion, money will flow back into the MEMES.\n\n[The Big Triangle Thingy You've Probably Seen 1,000 Times Already](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7wz09ua0vvv71.jpg?width=1841&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29b78952cc21ea41be357476a63d691169d2ddf7)\n\nAh yes. The fan favorite. I often wonder if u\/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed b\\*tch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had. Be fully prepared to lose all the money you put in as an options play, but if you go stocks then you can control your risk a lot better. Don't take this as real financial advise, as I'm just a fellow retard looking to be ready for Meme Frenzy Round 3.",
        "3":"Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r\/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.\n\n\nEdit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.",
        "4":"Alright tards,\n\nI've been on a bit of a hiatus from this sub. It's taken me a while to see a reason to return and not just lurk but I have stumbled upon a seemingly credible reason to return and talk about some other stocks other than my beloved GME, AMC, BB, PLTR, etc. \n\nSo I was watching Meet Kevin interview Marc Cohodes yesterday, https:\/\/youtu.be\/3MDW6x6nJTE , and at the end Kevin asks him about some of the names he is into and Marc responds with a good discussion about battery tech, highly recommend giving a listen, and the company he is invested in that is in this space, Enovix(ENVX). I started doing my own research on this company and stumbled upon a battery day video from a few months back, https:\/\/youtu.be\/r8mvMeaa3t0 , in which the CEO, Harrold Rust, is discussing what his company does and why they are poised to DOMINATE! Highly recommend giving this a listen to as well. I am extremely bullish on this stock and would love to see a discussion start around them. They went public via SPAC months ago and have a primary focus of raising capital. The founders, CEO included, are all buddies who worked at IBM back in the day and I think this could be a game changer! Cohodes also pointed out that battery tech and the industry, especially utilizing high amounts of silicon, could become a national security issue with all that is going on in the broader market right now. Something to think about. Need some Apes to get that capital formation going and this bitch will fly!\n\nTL;DR Enovix(ENVX) is poised to DOMINATE the future of battery. They have made leaps in the area of architecture and due to this, they are able to accomplish battery performance that absolutely fucks current leaders in the pooper. CEO says they are aimed at raising capital and once they have that, they can begin to really show their balls.\n\n\nEdit 1: Options look poised to cause SERIOUS gamma ramp with $30 strike price being the highest for the shortest term contracts(19 November) and a history of being able to jump that much in price in less time than a month. Current price is around $22. This could be a play that yields SERIOUS returns. Capital formation gets to a point that the company can start making moves and this thing is going to RUNNNNN \ud83d\ude80",

        "6":"Disclaimer: This is not dd. This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the data in figure 6 does NOT include all the shorts. It is merely a representative sample of shorts. Looking at the absolute quantity of shorts buying here is meaningless. However, given that it still seems odd to me that in the period between Feb 6th and Feb 12th, a massive quantity of shorts (something like 100% of the float) must have been covered according to this graph without any noticeable effect on price. Comments are disappearing for me for some reason and I am going to sleep. Play nice and stop downvoting comments posing resolutions other than higher than reported short interest into the ground. This is a discussion thread. Not a GME circle jerk thread. We are working through this report together to make sense of it and the purpose of this thread is to find clarity on something that seemed off to me and a bunch of other individuals not to just try to hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\n\n~~The figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year  which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn't seem to come close.~~ (I'm retarded and don't know my months apparently) Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil\/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn't seem reflected in the price action over that period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the 'apes' say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the 'apes' are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? 'Apes' are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)\n\nEdit: Yeah the graphs are not in the same time period, but still looking at them and given that nearly the entire float was closed between jan 27 and feb 12. Figure 6 is still odd-looking.\n\nEdit 2: Figure 6 is a bit misleading because of the size of the candles. Keep in mind while viewing that there was a huge amount of volume during this period in the realm of 100 mil a day. Still significant, but that does mean it is less than one would first think. Additionally, in the notes it makes clear that this is not all the short buy volume just those from big players. Thanks to u\/StonkGodCapital for raising that point. However, I would say that I still think it is odd that the report implies that so much covering (of almost an entire float worth of covering) occurred during the pre-February 12th, but post squeeze period despite us seeing very boring price movement in that period.",
        "7":"(Disclaimer, I'm long CCL with a combination of long calls and long shares. I am short a few covered calls with CCL shares of collateral too as a risk-management tool.)\n\nLots of my friends are apes, and I love that this subreddit has made them rich, so this is my attempt at giving back and making apes rich. I'm more of a Warren Buffett style investor, and I'm kinda anti social media so I have never posted here or even on Reddit. But CCL is an opportunity all investors should love, apes, speculators, and value investors alike.\n\nCCL is the last reopening play still trading at a 50% discount from it's pre-COVID peaks. This price is not justified: it is as undervalued as GME or AMC.\n\nRight now it\u2019s fallen to a support of 23 a share. Looking at the last times CCL fell to a support of 23 should show you the market is overlooking a big play.\n\nLast time we were at 23 was only September 18th 2021, and since then CCL has announced they are fully booked through 2023, and they\u2019ve refinanced a lot of high rate debt they put on earlier in the pandemic thus ending their liquidity crisis and giving them the cash on hand to expand their fleet further. Delta and United\u2019s earnings last week shows that travel stocks have recovered, or will soon recover. Merck's antiviral will further boost reopening plays. Americans have a well documented cash glut that will translate into luxury sales, like a cruise ship vacay. Even Morningstar, fucking Morningstar, agrees that 23 is a low price\u2013though their fair price of 27 still feels pretty low. \n\nIn fact, CCL is down from its recent high of 26 in September, down from 30 where it stood before the Delta variant stunted a number of reopening plays, and down from 60 where it was before the pandemic.\n\nHow can this be? Oh, because like GME and AMC it's a popular short target. The put to call ratio is 1.2. Definitely not as dramatic as AMC or GME was, but buying and holding will make a few hedgies cry.\n\nBecause the hedgies are so obviously fucking wrong on this. For 23 bucks, I am going to hold CCL and never let go, because owning a company with orders booked through 2023 and at half the price it was in 2019 is pretty fucking rad.\n\nIf you could see the deep fucking value in AMC and GME, you can see that CCL's value is as rich as the deep blue sea. I'm hodling, feel free to get rich with me.\n\nLinks:\n\nHedge Funds are Dumping CCL (lol this article was published while I was writing this post): [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html)\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) Announces More U.S. Homeport Ship Restarts for January and February 2022:\n\n[https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022](https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022)\n\nCarnival Corporation: Liquidity Crisis Averted\n\n[https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted](https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted)",
        "8":"Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**\n\n*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  \n***The endless cycle:***  \n*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > \u2026*\n\n***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  \n*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this.*  \n*Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.\"*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*",

If this happens I think it will run to at least the August high at about $230 and could go much higher if the Ape Army returns.\n\nDecember Earnings and the holiday shopping season are also potential catalysts for a run, but we probably also need the overall market to stop bleeding for this to play out.\n\nI think it could continue to be rangebound for another couple weeks, but we are setting up for a big move one way or another after that.

        "19":"**TLDR**\n\nHow does GameStop justify it's valuation of over $10B in market cap, while threats to it's core business accelerate? Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.\n\nCreate a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.\n\n**Context**\n\nYou are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d. Recent \u201cMeme Stock\u201d speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nGameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the \u201cnext generation\u201d of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.\n\n**Challenges to the GameStop business model**\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the \u201cstay at home\u201d nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop\u2019s second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01\n\nThe major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, \u201cWe don\u2019t; we sell the consoles at a loss\u201d. This is because the console market is a \u201chardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/tech\/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).\n\nEach major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop\u2019s future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8oinqe1n5eq71.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=87642bdceb199637d685574151f7187bf5ea600a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6jnphvuu5eq71.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ad77c6d92c331c85b1655ae05228eb2b48a1830\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/43jwbbdw5eq71.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ddee48f6f1a306a14190f9295d409eb7071736\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mc7nzn646eq71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=5211fe1ededf644821da80b6b1e473908cfbb742\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gcbxjbi66eq71.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8e767f4b5cc2e6659acbcf0f50fc610da1f6e1\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xjld30ob6eq71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31d223ab51937b2727af8eec83fbc268e5c6654\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It\u2019s estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.\n\n1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.\n2. GameStop could try to become the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.\n3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC\u2019s, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).\n4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.\n5. Leverage GameStop\u2019s brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive \u201cdrops\u201d and releases.\n\nSWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it\u2019s growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it\u2019s profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It\u2019s not feasible for GameStop to do so.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457\n\nIn analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop\u2019s future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/081315\/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City\u2019s footsteps.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games\/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it\u2019s existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS\/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/08\/24\/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.\n\nUltimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg \u201cStickiness\u201d), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect \u201ccoins\u201d that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.\n\nUtilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e\n\nGameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation\/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.\n\n**Measuring Success**\n\nEach customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining\/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with \u201cFree to Play\u201d games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/18\/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue\/)).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nYou would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.\n\nThe initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:\n\n1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)\n2. Four Engineers (Mining\/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)\n3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)\n4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)\n5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)\n6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)\n7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)\n\nAfter MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Would you leave your console on to mine game coins?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important Note: I have no holdings in GME or interest in the company. This is not investment advice.**",

Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:\n\n* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases\n* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products\n* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them\n\nBasically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \\[2\\], reputations can make or break a company\u2019s performance.\n\nIn one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ok4l9c\/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the\/). So this week, let\u2019s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)\n\n**Data**\n\nWhile there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https:\/\/www.reptrak.com\/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.\n\nThey base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.\n\nI am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \\[2012 - 2021\\]\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nRepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.\n\nEven though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \\[3\\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \\[4\\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \\[5\\]\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5\n\n **Results** \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)\n\nCompanies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.\n\nMy hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796\n\n Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year\u2019s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7\/10 years \\[6\\]. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)\n\nBut, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \\[5\\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)\n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year\u2019s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.\n* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \\[7\\]\n* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cp1acpytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a8269e8083fdbdf4f44e9ef093ee54ee2b73c1)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you\/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \\[8\\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.\n\nOur analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market!

It\u2019s from a wide variety of industries.

        "22":"### TLDR:\n\nSimplex Trading LLC is the last remaining financial entity listed in the Bloomberg Terminal\u2019s list of PUTs for GME maintaining a file date for their positions of **3\/31\/2021**.  They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6\/30\/2021**.\n\nI believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9\/30\/2021** and onward.\n\n### Background\n\nIn January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/marketintelligence\/en\/news-insights\/latest-news-headlines\/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).\n\nArchegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https:\/\/www.credit-suisse.com\/media\/assets\/corporate\/docs\/about-us\/investor-relations\/financial-disclosures\/results\/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It\u2019s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-04-03\/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). \n\n> \u201cTypically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.\u201d - https:\/\/www.stout.com\/en\/insights\/article\/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting\n\nOn March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/)).  This was notable because the Fed\u2019s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAs evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan\/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.\n\nHistorically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-07-08\/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).\n\n9\/30\/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.\n\nThere is a process called \u201cWarehousing\u201d in the CLO world where \u201cCLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date\u201d which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https:\/\/www.pinebridge.com\/en\/insights\/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).\n\n**9\/30\/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.\n\nGME close on 3\/31\/2021: $189.82\n\nGME close on 6\/30\/2021: $214.14\n\nGME close on 9\/30\/2021: ???\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.  Worth noting 9\/30\/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos\u2019 contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.\n\nJust a Retail Investor, not a financial advisor.",

However what these posts do not mention, is that there are **203 million DeepGreen shares of which 55% are immediately unlocked.** I'm not denying that at the moment the acquisition closed and the 8-K was released on **September 9th,** the float was 2.7 million. However there are \\~100 million shares that have been eligible to be sold since then, so the **float has increased WAY BEYOND 2.7M SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE SPAC**. \n\n# DID YOU CHECK THE OP's CLAIMS BEFORE YOLOING?\n\nThe 2.7 million float thesis has been posted so much across WSB\/Stocktwits\/Twitter. So many times that everyone took it as fact. However this fact could be refuted with about 30 minutes of research on SEC EDGAR (free resource). If you paid for BamSEC ($35\/month), you could have probably found the evidence refuting this in about 5 minutes.\n\nHere's my thread on why the 2.7 million float was wrong, posted on **THURSDAY when the stock was at $12.34 (stock down \\~45% since then).**\n\n[Why are people lying about $TMC Float? Float is 100+ million, not 2.7 million LOL](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppu3d1\/why_are_people_lying_about_tmc_float_float_is_100\/) (Negative 47 upvotes, 48 comments)\n\nI haven't posted on WSB in 8 months but the pumping and lying about the float was so pathetic that I had to chime in. However people just called me retarded, so I loaded $5 puts.\n\n# DEEP GREEN SHAREHOLDERS - DESPERATE TO SELL\n\nI'm not going to go into the DD on the actual company. I think most here understand it's worth $0-$2 max and a squeeze based on 2.7 million float was the main thesis. DeepGreen shareholders understand this too and are clearly dumping the 55% of their shares that are unlocked. They are probably writing off their 6 month locked shares as worth $0. But they are still making bank because WSB and stocktwits are driving liquidity for them to dump.\n\n# WSB DRIVES LIQUIDITY SO INSIDERS CAN DUMP\n\nThis company is such a fraud and valuation so ridiculous that several PIPE investors reneged on their commitments and would rather take their chances in court then fund this thing. DeepGreen shareholders know this and are desperate to get out. To get out at reasonably inflated prices they need liquidity or this thing will go to zero as they all dump. Que the hundreds of posts on WSB pumping this thing. Even the buyers today scooping up 'cheapies' at $7 will get smoked. DeepGreen shareholders are happy to sell something that is intrinsically worthless for $7. Heck they would be happy to dump their shares at $2 (and will be doing this in a few weeks I reckon).\n\n# BUT BUT CEO CONFIRMED 2.7 MILLION FLOAT REEEE\n\nNo he fucking didn't. Watch the interview for yourself and don't just take someone's word for it. He was very very careful to say float is low (subjective) and not confirm the 2.7 million figure that reddit is pushing. Also this is a fraudulent Canadian underwated mining company with a fraudster CEO who wore a fucking **T-Shirt** to ring the bell of the NYSE last Friday. So the fact that you all didn't take what he said with a grain of salt is hilarious. \n\n# QUESTION EVERYTING (AND GET REAL)\n\nIt seems like every post on WSB now is \"Reeee if we all buy alot of shares price go up.\" Zero sum games are not going to make WSB money in the aggregate. Hive mind behavior opens up WSB to be scammed like they were with $TMC. All it took for DeepGreen and other insiders to dump shares in this company worth $0 was a fake float number posted several times on WSB . The kicker is that the pump was most likely coordinated by the company itself. \n\n**To WSB's credit, it seems like most commenters understood the company was fraudulent and were only getting in on this for a squeeze play. However, if you know the company is fraudulent, maybe next time spend 15-30 minutes confirming if the 'float' supporting the squeeze play is actually accurate (SPOILER: IT WASN'T).**\n\nPositions:\n\n50 Oct 15 $5 PUT @ 22 cents\n\n20 Nov 19 $5 PUT @ 60 cents",

        "26":"**TLDR: Stop gambling you allowance money without doing some due diligence. Read and you might learn something.** \n\n**Some intro:** I model how market making options moves underlying stocks. This has led to some cool predictions like a certain GameStore on a certain week in January doing some unusual things. Seriously go check my stuff out. Options move the underlying in a very quantifiable manner. Additionally examining the OI gives insights into market sentiment and price expectations. \n\n**Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started.**\n\nOptions are extremely volatile. That's why we're all here but Market Makers follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason. Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid\/Ask (literally making the market). MM's usually have both ends of a trade, i.e short both calls and puts, which balances out but the net difference results in a directional position. This has to be hedged for multiple reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt and 2.  betting against clients (this is serious.) They make their money from scalping the B\/A and IV crush. Options are priced that if \u0394 neutral, the MM makes money when IV decreases and loses if it increases. \n\nThat brings us to Delta (\u0394). **\u0394 is the rate of change with respect to spot price (+\/- $1)**. Now that doesn't mean anything but think about \u0394 as the % chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. Gamma \u0393 is the rate of change of \u0394 for +\/- $1 on the underlying. \u0393 is also hedged on MM books. This is done by trading shares and contracts of the underlying which influences price discovery resistance levels. \n\nTo model this we make a few assumptions:\n\n* All contracts are being hedged directionally neutral (This isn't true but is an acceptable assumption to yield a working model)\n* The directional risk of a call and put on the same strike counteract\n* Enough of the boring stuff\n\nThis will be less in depth and more broad in scope than my previous work. More of an overview for the week. A few of these tickers (the SPACS) were requests and not my own positions. Also ignore the \"Hybrid Factor %\". I'm trying something new to  measure signal.

However, after seening [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pppfro\/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head\/) and [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pph9f0\/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack\/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n>\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n>  \n>This is just a tribute.  \n>  \n>Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n>  \n>This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u\/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and\/or u\/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC\/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n>  \n>The value of any stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n>  \n>Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n>  \n>**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during\/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout \/ trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!\n\n[Vasco da Gama can\u2019t be wrong ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gt1rnbz7e2o71.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6db503236cce3d87f8c4511221e8b5e30f91bb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# III. Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it\u2019s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IV.

I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!)

As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more!

Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification.

        "30":"Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends\/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",

I did not, however, ask for further details.\n\nBased on the advice given in this community I decided to ask Dan yesterday wether it was okay for me to have sex with my wife. He thought I wasn't ready yet. \"You should watch us doing it first, go hide in the closet\", he said.\n\nNext thing you know I'm hiding in his closet and what do you know, my wife walks in to the room. \"Finally someone who does not talk about PLTR all the time, He's been talking about yoloing his pension savings all day\", she said. \"Yeah he should buy puts on GME\", said Dan (what a stupid monkey, I thought) while unzipping his pants.

        "39":"# GME has a negative beta.\n\nFor those that don't know, this means that the stock moves *opposite of the direction from the overall market.*  So, if the overall market is going up, GME should be going down and vice versa.  Not only is this kind of thing **rare to see**, but the significance of it with GME fits the theory that the stock is outrageously short.\n\n# So, why is this important?\n\nThere is an expected taper to happen from the Federal Reserve soon.  Although specifics weren't mentioned, it has been rumored a 1-2% taper will happen which, should this happen, the markets will drop significantly.  If the taper is truly 1-2% without accounting for panic selling, the likely drop could be anywhere between 4-6% (overall).  This with the eventual contraction of monetary policy (which is much closer to us than we think) should cause the overall market to drop significantly as well.\n\nAssuming things play out like this, GME's negative beta at -2.0 should mean it would increase at the rate the overall market drops and those short on GME will likely be squeezed out which, as a result, will force **massive levels of liquidation** on other securities to cover their short positions (naked as well) furthering negative movement for the overall market.\n\n# GME's Beta vs Normal Stocks\n\nBeta is a pretty accurate tool and for most stocks unafflicted by this form of manipulation, the relationship between the overall market's movement and the unafflicted stock's movement is crystal clear.  Not only is a negative beta rare to see, but **it's inconsistency with the overall market is equally rare too**.  In essence, it shows manipulation is happening because there are bouts where GME actually moves with the market despite having a negative beta.  I'm not talking about small dips or gains eithers, I'm talking about the overall picture, where we've seen SPY hit 450 and GME has been all over the place, yet, it's negative beta stands.\n\nI don't have an immediate answer for this, but what we do know is that ETF's play a large role with those shorting meme stocks.  Same with options and thus, when we see GME move inconsistent with it's beta, what we're actually seeing is manipulation take place.\n\nTLDR\n\n* GME has a negative beta which suggests that the stock moves opposite of the overall market.\n* The Feds' taper and eventual contraction of monetary policy will cause the markets to drop significantly, which will likely the catalyst for shorts to be squeezed out.\n* GME has a negative beta because of short positions taken on it.  Whenever shorts become squeezed out of their positions, massive levels of liquidation on other securities will happen to cover their short position which, as a result, should drop the overall market.\n* The rate of GME's increase will likely be the rate of decrease for the overall market.\n* GME's beta is not only extremely rare to see, but the extreme inconsistencies of it's movement is equally rare.  This alone shows that manipulation is taking place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources\n\n[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/beta.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/beta.asp)\n\n[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27\/](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27\/)\n\n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow are two examples of when GME's beta reflects accurate movement.

I don't need all the money you guys are forced to make each year on the promised land. Just a note to keep in mind.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHere it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:\n\n- $30k\n- $15k\n- $8k from my girlfriend\n- $5k from credit cards\n- some savings from my regular job\n\nThe reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?\n\nThanks!\n\n**EDIT 2:** some people are doubting the authenticity of this post when I say I got a severance package after quitting. Severance package here is like 401k on the US. In some European countries, you don't get a choice and some money is taken from your salary each month and deposited as \"severance package\" by the company. When you switch jobs or quit, that money is given to you. If you held a job for 10 years, you get a really nice exit bonus.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I live in **Western Europe**, just not in a big city like London on Paris, but a smaller city.

Using my masterful TA skills, I'm going to cure you of that burning sensation you get when you ~~pee~~ *look at your portfolio*! With this ***one simple trick***, all of your terrible life choices will resolve themselves into brilliant investment decisions! And for the first time ever: featuring a TL;DR on a Cbass post. Wow!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: We're all going to be rich\\* as fuck!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. CLOV\n\nPart 2.

Begun, the Meme Wars have**\n\nThis past week saw an appreciable awakening of the memes, particularly GME and AMC, with knock-on effects across the whole of the Meme-verse. This was followed by a sea of gain porn and concomitant conspiracy theories about insiders among us.\n\nWell, ol' Cbass is here to clear things up with Star Wars references, bad jokes, and even worse TA. So let's have us a gander at some magic space-wizard charts to answer the age old question: ***Am I going to lose all my money.... again?***\n\nStarting with the OG, GME:\n\n[We're comin' fer ya, hedgies! Reee!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1a4yyt2we6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef8fcd2046ff1417684d4a52f17a0353ff02e03)\n\nAccording to my long since discarded thesis, GME was supposed to find support at the $218 level where the last breakout occurred (Launch #3). That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of the #3 line.\n\nSo, does GME have it in itself to enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns).\n\nFrom a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all.\n\n**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:\n\n[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ja0puvoug6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab226485fe17812dfc4c94cd4d0d661d31d6eb56)\n\nMy previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my \"original\" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.\n\nHaving found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice.\n\nFrom a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and \"fundamentals\" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*.\n\n**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:\n\n[Extra \\\\\"special\\\\\" line drawing skills here](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o39cqkfcj6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a723faac2fda7a0dfffd6e5248d5665bac3f7b8)\n\nJust like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about).\n\nFrom the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares.\n\nOn the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more.\n\n**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:\n\n[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/45d9m8f9m6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3985c252a10b333677c7749da916ebf1b6f171)\n\nNow, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.\n\nLike the others above, CLOV has broken out of a downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \\~$8 line is proving to be the actual bottom.\n\nOn the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, \"Yeah, nah bitch,\" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand.\n\n**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P\/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**\n\nIt's conspiracy theory time! Yayy!\n\nSo the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence.\n\nFirst, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8\/20 expiry. Together with the 7\/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'\n\nSecond, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes.\n\nNow... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let\/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them on the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up.\n\nBut they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock \"movement\" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.\n\n**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it.\n\nEven disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap.\n\n**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.\n\n[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s1xs80j3y6k71.jpg?width=2181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80ffff00b19d3dea26c921fe6337e039c10b8a8e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3. A New Hope**\n\nI've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with \"You had me at retard\" and \"I'm all in.\"\n\nNow it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is \"Fuck your pump & dump and your mom while we're at it!\" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably.\n\nWhile some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to \"normality,\" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, \"*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*.\" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good.\n\nSure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***.\n\nSo as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*! (^(Or Disney buys us))\n\n[Que the Journey, ladies and gentlemen.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g8isr2tq07k71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2dff374b682ca9cc4fef8539d121905c1401284)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*Rich can mean a lot of things, such as: rich in spirit, rich in experience, or rich in delusions of grandeur.**\n\nPositions or ban, a.k.a., the *Portfolio of Destiny*:\n\n[I've got 'em on the ropes, boys!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hk65a8ow17k71.jpg?width=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89bab8c2e7df13eec9c10c339c76940983978f34)\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar, per usual.\n\nEdit: I just now realized, a day later, that I used the wrong roman numeral in the title... fml.",

The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5sldutzq33j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=361a46ce8b8d54a87703e2409bc1896e50c9ae15\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n[VW](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7b6sm9t43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1da13436e92326b0ec63688d81f39f17574acb8)\n\n[and TSLA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iz041qtv43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1174f413961be8903377068f5e41ce538f115f23)\n\n[The OC post and analysis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ncwwuqz253j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=188c089eeef5aeb0308614caba55c538e84ccbe1)\n\nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n[AMCSS, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8\n\nWhat you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nwub7d\/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme\/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u\/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n[GME daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/klztgzo563j71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e54f3009eaafcd3c4aa5f4d04ef0779fe69803a)\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-02-19\/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n>A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u\/Criand:  \n\n\n>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r\/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u\/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n[Wow](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2pb2k9qv63j71.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe0cfb61c4db4c8c26fc5a464b8f25319b6e59c\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n[The scene is from \u2018Inside Job\u2019 movie, a bright reminder of what\u2019s going to happen again, soon.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/1rflh5jy33j71\/player)\n\n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u\/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373\n\n>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u\/peruvian_bull again:\n\n>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity\/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n>  \n>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# \n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ebo8be5r93j71.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d68afe9f815a7723b6058a24db193828b419282\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kqwqmy9t93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=1618e8580829574b8f3df117d5e837287e043405\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/m0gwzvob43j71\/player\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**\n\n[SPY daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w51ks5l2b3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c7374f9a4f3d991386a6fea8c6b66108354d8f4)\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/), and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/o0fjdb\/this_time_its_different\/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n[VIX daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mcg9etbeh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=728359435209bdb792327427e3cea524528d6908)\n\n[GME daily chart, log scale](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xbskfzdkh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c2451c6bc584e43f1497d8ca6acc141cb8e21d4)\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

Short interest (15% of shares outstanding) and borrow rates (less than 2% per year) have been rapidly declining.**  **Most hedge funds that are short AMC are short in small sizes, allowing them the ability to hold their short positions indefinitely. AMC is not GameStop \u2013 GameStop is led by a visionary CEO and actually has a viable path towards transforming itself. AMC, on the other hand, is stuck with its old CEO and management team and faces significant revenue cannibalization from home streaming services (which has been exacerbated by the pandemic).**\n\nIntroductory Disclosure: \n\nEven though I reference GameStop (GME), I do not advocate buying shares in GME. I also do not hate AMC or think anyone who bought AMC is foolish. I have been invested in both stocks. With this post, I am trying to be as objective and helpful as possible. \n\nMany of you may consider me a shill because I do not share all your opinions and\/or urge you to hold AMC until the stock reaches some non-sensical price target.  That is fine.  But I am definitely not a shill per the actual definition of the word in that I am not an accomplice to anyone. \n\nI invest money for a living and have run my own investment fund for over a decade. It\u2019s not a huge hedge fund like Citadel, but I have outside investors. I also have a lot of my own money in my investment fund. I have no special agenda other than making money for myself and my investors. I also do not have special access to regulators, AMC or other large investment funds including hedge funds, short-oriented or otherwise.  I hardly ever speak with other portfolio managers. I can\u2019t manipulate stocks (I wish I could, legally of course). If you imagine the equity market as every casino in the world, maybe Citadel is MGM Resorts, and I\u2019m just a card shark counting cards at the blackjack table. \n\nWe do a lot of research on our positions. I am here to share some of that research for no other reason than I find this community fascinating. I like underdogs. I often root for them.  But, to be clear, I\u2019m just trying to make money and have recently invested based on this diligence. Specifically, I am long AMC puts.\n\n**The AMC Short Squeeze is Over**\n\nI joined Reddit during the GME short squeeze. To be sure, it was a great way to make money. GME had over 100% short interest when Ryan Cohen joined the Board, so it appeared to many that the short squeeze was going to happen. Good for everyone that saw it early. \n\nThe GME short squeeze really did happen. GameStop traded to over $450 per share. Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME\u2019s short interest declined to less than 10% of shares outstanding. Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem. The stock dropped to $40 per share and the short squeeze was over. As many of you put it, the squeeze was squeezed. That part of the trade had concluded. \n\nAMC also experienced a squeeze, or more accurately, the perception that a squeeze could happen. Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly (we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying).  Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5-10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position. Buyers, including and maybe especially retail traders, continued to overwhelm sellers. As that occurred at the end of May and early June, AMC shares ran up to $72 per share. Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life-changing money.  Some did.  \n\nThe problem is the squeeze (or, more accurately, the perception of the squeeze) ended, and now the stock is drifting lower every day. The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kuyjlumh0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af96d60af7932c3117851ae40d9cdad8b988d29\n\nBorrow rates are consequently diminishing as well - shorting doesn't cost that much anymore (less than 2% per year) and there is plenty of borrow available. If you need to cover your short, you can do so pretty easily. For example, if you\u2019re short 1 million shares, you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn\u2019t move the stock at all. Remember, covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price. AMC trades over 50 million shares a day. People keep yelling \u201cthey have to cover!\u201d Or, \u201cwe own the float!\u201d Both of those things are true. But when someone wants to cover, they don\u2019t need to ask for everyone\u2019s permission. They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it. That\u2019s how it works.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9lne56ti0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff4c1d06207b571e3adbc8f41d37149e149ec4a\n\nFinally, hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds. In other words, most are assuming over 200% price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them. For all intents and purposes, they can hold these short positions forever. This is not a recipe for a short squeeze.\n\n**AMC is not GameStop.** \n\nAfter the GME squeeze ended, GameStop continued transforming itself. GameStop raised a ton of cash ($500 million in April), paid down all its debt, and then raised even more cash ($1 billion in June). In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure, Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top-notch managers. GameStop (current market cap: $14.5 billion) now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon. Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy (current market cap: $35 billion). Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business.  Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon, Best Buy and others.  \n\nThe value reflected in GameStop\u2019s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation. The gamble on the short squeeze is over. GME is trading fairly rationally right now \u2013 maybe a little expensive considering the road to $35 billion is going to be really bumpy. GameStop\u2019s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding. \n\nAMC, on the other hand, has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible. AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider, including video game producers, are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home. AMC does not have Ryan Cohen. It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through $5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations. With this debt burden, and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen, Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit. Consequently, AMC doesn\u2019t have a shot at competing against Disney, Netflix, Amazon and every other streamer. AA\u2019s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock. My bet is that he\u2019s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying.\n\nBut enough of my opinions. Here are the facts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zia6u1mj0zd71.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=07ac2e7e676c7ffe15957086337e4174696b2c7b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wm4q3b4k0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03689104ff0bfabdaef53a94c12c7c2c75b13e6\n\nClearly, 2021 box office is well below 2018 box office on both a cumulative and weekly basis.  But yes, we are in a pandemic, and theaters are closed, so let\u2019s look at revenue per theater.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8fj54nk0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bf2b12ff11fcd2d6bea2a4a6bc73a75e9d3701\n\nAlthough improving, 2021 box office per theater is well below 2018. Even last week, when Disney released its expected blockbuster Black Widow, box office per theater is well below 2018 levels.  The reason for this is actually pretty straightforward. The battle for viewers is no longer in the theater. It\u2019s at home. In 2018, Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ combined had 164 million subscribers. Now they have over 350 million. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w1nawg2l0zd71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=165d1c90746723ed10c03b1252323166110c854c\n\nThe major studios are no longer competing against each other. They are competing against Netflix and Amazon. In 2018, Netflix and Amazon produced 77 films. In 2020, they produced 145, most of which were never intended to be displayed in theaters. Amazon recently bought The Tomorrow War from Paramount for over $200 million. Rather than releasing it in theaters, Amazon digitally released it instead on Prime Video. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nqxll5gl0zd71.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ceab142dbb333a09f82687d6307ad4b0c4a68a1\n\nA lot of Redditors say \u201cwell, AMC makes most of its money on concessions.\u201d That is actually not true. Over 62% of AMC\u2019s revenue and 48% of AMC\u2019s gross profit comes from actual ticket sales. Even if it were true, people need to visit theaters in order to buy popcorn and candy and soda, so tickets and concessions are joined at the hip. You can\u2019t have one without the other. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0yakedbm0zd71.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f523348018dc1ef621eadff4e7fcc8975c2e4c\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI'm not telling you what to do.

        "58":" I agree that GME is getting close for  a rip. From a TA perspective, its trading in a high volume area. When I look at GME from a weekly time frame, Money Flow has been increasing over the last 4 weeks, this usually tells me its under accumulation. I saw this move in AMZN before it ripped. But as we all know, It is very difficult to time a move.\n\nSince Options dictate a lot of moves, I like to take look at how MM's are  positioned with GEX or known as Gamma Exposure. Gamma Exposure is really good if you like to sell options overall as it can provide information where Gamma Walls are at. Also can use it to know when to take profits. For example, on $DIS there is a Call Gamma Wall at 185. On Monday I took some profits on my calls since it is close to that PT.\n\nNow back to GME. We are currently in  neg gamma territory and under a put wall at 170. If we cant close above  this tomorrow, we could see 150 imo, the next high neg gamma area which I  believe should provide good support. But you can also see, a close over 200, Call Gamma Wall, can make it fly with little resistance above.

        "59":"Greetings retards, autists and apes. Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice.\n\n# Preface\n\nToday is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.\n\nGME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.\n\n# Where we are at\n\nToday just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports:\n\n7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER.\n\n2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( \ud83d\ude80 ) and below it is bearish (\ud83c\udf08).\n\n4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.\n\n6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma\/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)\n\nNot only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* \/u\/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1\/20\/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*\n\nBut wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ\/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7\/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues.\n\nAll this being said, today I would put us at or around 3\/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.\n\n# Where we are going\n\nAll these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).\n\nAt the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.\n\nNow, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \\~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3\/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard.\n\n# GamePlan\n\n**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ\/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close.\n\nIF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.\n\nTargets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.\n\nIF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation.\n\n**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8\/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings.\n\n# Footnotes\n\nPositions: 7\/16 170c, 180c, 190c, 7\/23 190c. Be realistic with OTM calls. 800c will not print.\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

        "60":"By Sin\u00e9ad Carew\n\n(Reuters) -Shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment and video game retailer GameStop Corp fell sharply on Wednesday and were both trading below half their recent peak prices, testing the fortitude of the stocks' retail shareholders.\n\nAMC, in its fourth straight day of losses, closed down 15% at $33.43, close to 54% below its all-time high of $72.62 reached in early June. The stock earlier fell as low as $33.25 to its lowest point since June 1.\n\nGameStop finished down 6.9% at $167.62 after hitting a session low of $165.07, compared with its June 8 high of $344.66. GameStop, which hit a record high of $483 in late January, also registered a fourth straight day of declines.\n\nThe companies have been at the center of epic rallies in so-called meme stocks that have captivated Wall Street, hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors. Both are still sitting on big year-to-date gains. AMC was still up 1,476% so far in 2021 while GameStop was up 789% for the year to date.\n\nTheir recent declines may test the individual investors that have purchased their shares in recent months, often touting their buys on sites such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets.\n\n\"When things are going up it's easy to get on board,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. \"It could go significantly lower because there's less interest in the trade. People hate to lose money much more than they love to make money.\"\n\nThe decline in AMC shares came even after a strong weekend at the box office, when Walt Disney Co and Marvel's superhero adventure movie \"Black Widow\" captured $80 million in the biggest opening weekend for a movie since the pandemic.\n\nDollarhide noted that Disney also generated $60 million globally from selling the movie on its direct-to-consumer streaming service, which competes with movie theaters.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic kept theaters and other businesses shuttered for months. Concerns about the surge in cases of the latest COVID-19 variant may be exacerbating declines in so-called reopening stocks such as AMC, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler.\n\n\"It's a stock that was trading up very high because it was a momentum trade and when the momentum dries up a little bit it comes down,\" Handler said.\n\nFor the full year 2021, AMC is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $3.16 on revenue of $2.41 billion. For its fiscal year ending in January 2022, GameStop is expected to report a loss per share of $0.56 on revenue of $5.57 billion. Estimates for both companies were collected by Refinitiv. As of Tuesday's close, about 78 million shares of AMC, or almost 16% of its float, were sold short, according to the latest estimate from S3 Partners. That compares with 75 million shares sold short as of June 30.\n\nAbout 8.68 million shares in GameStop, or 14.9% of its float, was sold short as of Tuesday's close, compared with 8.22 million on June 30, according to S3.\n\n(Reporting By Sin\u00e9ad Carew; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Will Dunham)",

These are more likely to have a bullish outcome. However, this is on a longer timeframe. It would break up above **344** and targets **400 --> 450 --> 500.** You would want a daily close to seal the deal. This setup breaks down and is invalid below **163,** from there - no support until **145.**\n\n**(TEAL)**\n\nDescending channel coming from downside. This are bearish in nature. It means the near term trend is down and likely to stay that way unless we break above the upper boundary with a daily close. In this case, you would need a break above **209,** which would target **241.26, 274.29, 291.30 -** and **maybe** the top of the pattern at **344.** Until then, it is sell the rip short term.\n\nWhen a pattern breaks against it's bias - the resulting move is often less pronounced and I look for about half the move I would look for if it broke with it's bias. That's why in this scenario, if we broke above, you would want to see it form a **bull flag, falling wedge, or ascending triangle (continuation pattern)** to get that true follow through to the far end.\n\nThis breaks down with the red setup below that **163** level.\n\n(**YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **291.30, 274.29, 241.26, 205.49, 189.66.** Below, they are resistance. Above, they are support. Under the pattern, support is **145.00, 100.00.**\n\nMoving onto $AMC -\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xn42mhw5v1b71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=7785ff88f6b50dedbc23436c5b235dad4ae3e759)\n\n**(RED)**\n\nWith that large bounce on **7\/8 -** this has actually become a **falling wedge.** These are **bullish** in nature. That being said, we are obviously in danger of breaking it down today. For that to not happen, we must hold **38.54** on every daily close, sloping down each day. Below, **the setup is invalid** and nearby support is at **36.77** and **33.61.**\n\nThe pattern breaks up on a daily close above **55.00** sloping down each day. Price targets for the breakout would be **65.10, 75.00, 100.00.**\n\n**(YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **65.10, 61.18, 51.00, 36.77, 33.61, 20.46, 16.79.** There is a few more but they are so far away there is no reason to plot them. I try to keep my charts as clean as possible.\n\nNote the gap at **33.61 -** this is also one of the most important supports on the chart. Gaps like to be filled, and it's likely we do fill this one.\n\nRemember a breakdown is always confirmed by a candle close on it's respective chart, in this case the daily. For that reason, we could see a candle wick under - fill the gap - wick back over. A close under that level would be very unhealthy and likely mark a move back to **20.46.** This is the highest probability point to go short.\n\n\\---\n\n*Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball.

        "63":"Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to read a novel? We'll you've come to right post, friend! This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all: charts **and** text! With a side of **disappointment** and **shattered dreams**! All for the low price of wasting time you didn't need anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. The Meme Demystified\n\nPart 2. The Meme Charts\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. BBBY\n5. CLOV\n6. SPCE\n\nPart 3. The U.S.S. Failboat\n\n1. RKT\n2. WOOF\n\nPart 4. The Week Ahead\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 1. The Meme Demystified**\n\nMy basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar, and somewhat predictable pattern. There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays. This is wrong. In fact, they are all basically the same play, with some variation. Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Memes**: This just boils down to retail attention; DDs, memes, ppl posting stupid yolos, etc.\n2. **Option wizardry**: Seeing there is a 'new thing' over on the ol' internets and it's going up, some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities, forcing market makers to hedge, **the thing** then happens.\n3. **Diamond handing**: A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices, then once they're sitting on devastating losses, they say to themselves: 'you know I *always* believed in this company' and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes, and they'll *never* sell.\n4. **Higher-low**: The refusal to sell by the ~~retards~~ brilliant new investors who see value that others don't, *causes* the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher-low, proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something.\n5. Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the charts in the next part, it's my contention that the higher-low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move. In other words: spike, drop to breakout, stabilize there, spike again, drop to second breakout, stabilize there, ... repeat until lambo.\n\nSPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it's early year breakouts, but I'm not sure it ever properly fit the pattern.\n\n***There's no fucking pattern, dipshit. TA doesn't work on meme stocks! It's just randomness!!!!*** I hear you typing in your comment. I see a pattern in these moves. Further, the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well (GME, part 1, notwithstanding). As does the effect of diamond handing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 2. The Meme Charts**\n\nFirst, let me say the State of the Memes this week is **wounded**.  As the charts show, across the board (except SPCE) the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit.\n\nStarting with GME:\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ukgcqozlnma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3c70553d72942ff2d3e936e46239c6df908ef6)\n\nGME has completed four rounds on the wheel of lambos. It is, like all the meme stocks, experiencing the early stages of a break down of the pattern. You can fiddle around with where you think Launch #4 should be drawn and put it around $195, then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy.\n\nIs GME dead? No. Just wounded. Get back up into the Support Zone #4 and it's game on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext AMC:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dbivb5gkoma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1766b652351e92f9201c28b4fef1031796eaaa32)\n\nAMC is that weird kid you went to school with. He was nice enough, but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him. Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do\/say next. The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y'all bought damn-near the whole company already.\n\nIs AMC dead? No. It's a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to $14.54 before finding support. But at this point it could literally do anything. (Except go up again. That's definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation ... somewhere.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone's favorite Canadian, BB:\n\n[Oh, Canada!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6haay06epma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=52acbe79317f76bf4a9e43636c87a34890197c38)\n\nNot too shabby, not too great. Like the last girl you took home from the bar. You didn't have to get *that* drunk to make the call, but you weren't going to pick her sober.\n\nIs BB dead? No. We've broken under Support Zone #3 (or #2, if you don't want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch). However, we haven't completely collapsed, and if you know anything about TA, you know that you can just redraw the lines to reinforce that poorly thought out decision you made when you entered the position in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat bedside table selection, BBBY:\n\n[I really like these bedside tables... that I got from Wayfair.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e0d1mj63qma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3cefbc8df2ff395550d482556355d6bc7f8fe17)\n\nNobody talks about this ticker any more, but it actually looks like its in the best shape of the bunch.\n\nIs BBBY dead? Absolutely not. In fact, I'm thinking of using margin to hop aboard (cause almost all my money is tied up ~~bagholding~~ *with a long term investment in* CLOV). It found support this week right where it was supposed to and it ended the week with green candles. Maybe being forgotten about around here is a good thing.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeprechaun 8, The Night of Broken Dreams, CLOV:\n\n[I might have to visit a church..... how much do favors from Jesus cost, anyway?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9swz2j03rma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6333324df38e3cf30320f0b63f85547e0caead6)\n\nI'm really, really, *really*, hoping my thesis that the price needs to stabilize at the previous breakout point is wrong. Or that I'm drawing the breakout lines wrong. Or that Buddy Jesus is going to forgive me for all those hookers and all that cocaine. I'm sorry, okay!\n\nIs CLOV dead? No, but it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you. The $9 mark is basically the last hope. Unless you want to look to SPCE for your comparison (but that's just cherry picking charts to find one that helps you sleep at night; you know, standard practice for TA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocketman, Sir Big-balls Branson, SPCE:\n\n[Expect more rockets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8t2qm06sma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9ab72b20cd2f0662e9d3c64168c98454a63bc5)\n\nI'm not convinced this chart belongs with the others, but I squinted really hard and kinda sorta see how it might fit the pattern. There is just so much extra going on with SPCE that it is not going to play nice for TA.\n\nIs SPCE dead? Of course not. Branson survived, and that means SPCE is going to be just fine. Still, I think a retrace back to \\~$40 looking for support would not be unwarranted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 3. The U.S.S. Failboat**\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the failures, but RKT and WOOF stand out to me as examples of Team Fail.\n\nFirst, the not-rocketman, RKT:\n\n[This is not the way to the moon](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kbsinyb3tma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=db532489fb141a71183654af327c744cb68851d8)\n\nNo matter how you redraw my breakout line, this is a clear fail. In fact, after the push up, the stock put in an all-time **low**. That is not how you get a lambo.\n\nIs RKT dead? As a meme stock, yes. Dead and buried. As a long term investment? I could see the case for it, I guess...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnlike, WOOF, which is just hot garbage blended into your dog's food:\n\n[Rocket ship to the Center of Earth. That's where the adventure is!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zw4u0u7mtma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce8e9394e6f4be03d1cfddee607d7de0bbb93cb7)\n\nCan you even say this was *ever* a meme stock, proper? I don't think so. This is P&D action.\n\nIs WOOF dead? In all ways, yes. Wasn't there a pet company during the dotcom bubble that went tits up....? Some lessons need to be learned twice it seems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4. The Week Ahead**\n\nAs I said at the beginning of Part 2, the State of the Meme is **wounded**. Last week's action was bad, across the board for everyone not in SPCE (or somehow, someway, for reasons I'll never understand, holding NEGG....). It's not over yet, though. Wounded is not dead. Hell, even dead can just be *mostly* dead. That's what the Princess Bride taught me, and I've learned everything I know from movies, so it must be true.\n\nHowever, a stand **must** be made. A line in the sand **must** be drawn. Someone, somewhere, needs to stand up and say **enough is enough**. We are ~~human beings~~ *just oversized children* god-damnit!\n\nIf we have another week of across the board bleeding, shit has the potential to go south, and fast. On top of it, this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys. Expect maximum pressure. When you've got your opponent on his back foot, you don't let off, you hit harder.

        "64":"I\u2019m just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife\/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your \u201cshort squeeze\u201d DD isn\u2019t working?! Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.\n\nEDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- \n\nSomehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. \n\nSure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. \n\nBut you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I\u2019m ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. \n\nWhen you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I\u2019m just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It\u2019s fun.

        "65":"Hey guys! There\u2019ve been a lot of phenomenal sentiment trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach \u2014 what I did was create one that focuses just one what people in this sub are saying. I\u2019ve created my own sentiment analyzer, and have been investing in it for more than a year now. If you want to take a crack at using it yourself, here\u2019s the\u00a0[source code](https:\/\/github.com\/tstewart161\/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).\n\nNOTE: A popular sentiment investing ETF is a banned ticker, so I just called it Popular Sentiment Investing ETF\n\n# The Important Stuff\n\nLong story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, Popular Sentiment Investing ETF, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF **came out), compared to SPY's 10% and** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF's **7%.**\n\nI rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \\*\\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees\/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck Popular Sentiment Investing ETF. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF since its introduction.\u00a0\n\nYour typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and\/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment\/self text post.\n\n# How is sentiment calculated?\n\nThis uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive\/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment\/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdidn\u2019t really like\u201d as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cI LOVED\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe turkey was great, but I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the sides\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There\u2019s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There\u2019s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don\u2019t want to be doing that.\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \\*\\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like Popular Sentiment Investing ETF (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a \u201clong term SPY-beating strategy.\u201d\\*\\* I\u2019m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in Popular Sentiment Investing ETF, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.\n\nSo, the data from last week:\n\n# WSB - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what\u2019s in the portfolio)\n\nEstimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (the text file I store my data in ended up being 55mb -- it\u2019s nothing crazy but it\u2019s quite large for just text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Ticker**|**Comments\/Posts**|**Sentiment Score**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|WISH|5,328|2,839|\n|CLNE|4,715|1,317|\n|GME|4,660|904|\n|BB|2,216|780|\n|CLOV|2,094|777|\n|AMC|2,080|646|\n|WKHS|936|295|\n|CLF|908|269|\n|UWMC|855|165|\n|ET|804|153|\n|TLRY|569|116|\n|CRSR|451|79|\n|SENS|282|75|\n|ME|82|36|\n|SI|59|35|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSentiment score is calculated by looking at stock mentions, upvotes per comment\/post with the mention, and sentiment of comments.\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process\/results.",

        "67":"I recently commented on a post about GME that I sell covered calls (henceforth CCs) on meme stocks. The reception to the comment was poor \u2013 35 downvotes and counting. Upon reviewing responses to my comment, I realized that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of CCs. I hope to clear some of those up and introduce in what may be a new strategy to those who read this.\n\n**What does it mean to sell covered calls?**\n\nTo sell a covered call means to buy 100 shares of a stock and then sell a call option against the shares. When you sell the call, you collect a premium upfront. If the underlying stock is above the strike price on the expiry date, you will get assigned. Since you are \u201ccovered\u201d and own 100 shares of the underlying, you can deliver your shares to the holder of the call to satisfy your obligation. If the stock is below the strike price on the expiry date, you get to keep the shares. In either situation, the premium is yours to keep.\n\nThis strategy is different than selling a naked call option (i.e., selling a call without owning the underlying). In that strategy, you lose $1 for every cent the stock is above the strike price at expiry. With CCs, you own 100 shares of the stock, so those 100 shares were also able to make $1 for every cent in price appreciation. In essence, with CCs you are selling the upside above the strike price to the long of the trade.\n\n**Three strategies compared under four scenarios**\n\nThe best way to demonstrate why I believe this strategy is so valuable is to compare trading outcomes under four strategies \u2013 selling covered calls, owning 100 shares outright, and owning a call option.\n\nFor this example, I will use AMC shares which last traded at $54.23 and a 55 strike July 2 expiry call which last traded at $4.25. This example is for AMC, but this can be done with any stock if you substitute the applicable pricing.\n\nIf this is too much reading, I\u2019ve summarized what I believe is the best trading strategy in each price band within the chart below.\n\n[Trading strategies compared](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8c622ynpkw771.png?width=2604&format=png&auto=webp&s=8793805dbc8f0b621940bc7dc42bf1cb4d1b3640)\n\n*Scenario 1 \u2013 AMC goes down (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares will lose money; however, because you collected a premium, you are still ahead if AMC finishes above $49.98 ($54.23-$4.25). Even if AMC finishes below $49.98, you can \u201croll\u201d your option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425. I am giving this one a tie because if the stock tanks, the call has a 100% loss but in dollar terms the loss is limited. So in a sense the winner depends on how much the stock falls and if you believe the stock will recover in the future.\n\n*Scenario 2 \u2013 AMC stays at $54.23 (Winner: selling covered calls)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares neither make nor lose money; however, you profit the premium received of $425. Since $54.23 is below the strike of $55, you can roll the option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares neither make nor lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425.\n\n*Scenario 3 \u2013 AMC finishes in the range of $55-$59.25 (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning 100 shares outright)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares participate in the upside up until $55. This would mean a $77 profit on the shares (\\[$55-$54.23\\] x 100). You would also keep the premium of $425 which brings the total profit to $502. You would lose the shares as the stock finished above $55.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. So, if AMC finishes at $59.25, the profit would be $502 (\\[$59.25-$54.23\\] x 100).\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.25, you would breakeven (\\[$59.25-$55-$4.25\\] x 100).\n\n*Scenario 4 \u2013 AMC finishes above $59.68 (Winner: owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: Same as scenario 3. The profit is $502 and you lose your shares.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $545.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $42.69 (\\[$59.68-$55-$4.25\\] x 100). As a percentage of the original investment, this strategy has a higher ROI than owning 100 shares outright for stock prices above $59.68.\n\nThere are a few gaps in these scenarios, but the point should be clear by now. Selling covered calls is profitable in scenarios 2-4 and in scenario 1 if the stock is above $49.98. Owning 100 shares is profitable in scenarios 3 and 4 while owning a call was profitable in only scenario 4.\n\nThis is why I love selling covered calls \u2013 it is profitable in more market conditions than the other trading strategies. It will outperform other strategies unless the underlying stock makes a large move to the upside.\n\n**Misconceptions**\n\nI came across a few misconceptions in responses to my comment. Here are a few of them.\n\n*You can\u2019t make money on CCs if the stock goes up.* \u2013 Absolutely you would. If the stock goes up, you get to keep the premium. Only in selling a naked call would you not make money in this situation.\n\n*You shouldn\u2019t sell CCs on a high IV stock.* \u2013 Assuming you're bullish on the stock, high IV stocks are the best to target as you can collect more premium. This point is only correct if you anticipate a large downward move in the stock that would lose more than the premium received.\n\n*You should sell puts instead of CCs if you\u2019re bullish on the stock.* \u2013 There\u2019s some nuance to this, but this point is mostly incorrect. Due to something called put-call parity, selling a put is conceptually similar to selling a covered call. Both will benefit from the same price movements.\n\n**Downsides:**\n\nThere are a few downsides to CCs which you should consider before trading.\n\n*Funds required* \u2013 Selling covered calls requires owning 100 shares of the stock. This is capital intensive. Consider buying 100 shares of GME which would cost $20,800. Buying a GME July 2 expiry call with 0.71 delta (meaning you get price appreciation that replicates owning 71 shares) only costs about $2,443.\n\n*Stock tanks and never recovers* \u2013 If the stock tanks and never recovers, you won\u2019t be able to recoup your losses; however, even if this happens, your outcome is better than the other strategies from before since you got to keep the premium.\n\n*The upside is limited* \u2013 Your upside is capped at the strike price. If there\u2019s a strong movement upwards, the other strategies are better; however, there may be situations where you call \u201croll\u201d your option up in strike and out in expiry. This may allow you to keep stock.\n\nConclusion: Selling covered calls are an underrated trading strategy that is often misunderstood. It is profitable in a wide range of trading environments. Sure it may not be as \"sexy\" as buying FDs and it won't get you rich overnight, but it can possibly provide strong and consistent returns over time.",

For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly.\n\n\\- PLTR has been sleeping for a while, it's ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV.\n\n\\- [Karp is a Giga Chad](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwLx-qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx)\n\n# What is Palantir?\n\n\"Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai\", I've seen this thrown around quite a bit, and honestly wtf does that mean? I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer \"what is data\"? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company\/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https:\/\/www.palantir.com\/palantir-gotham\/21-launch\/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PalantirTech\/status\/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments\/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business\/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data\/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation\/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.\n\n# Why Palantir?\n\nWhy can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called \"data silos\" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.\n\nAnother benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.\n\nKarp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\nIf anyone's worried that the military may drop PLTR, [here ya go](https:\/\/www.defensenews.com\/land\/2019\/03\/29\/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract\/).\n\n# Why now?\n\nI did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -> $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nqa5x8\/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue\/), i explain the idea there.\n\n[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)\n\nfucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.\n\n# Why not AMC\/GME\/BB\/etc?\n\n**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME\/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.\n\n# Reversal\/Exit\n\nUnfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position**:\n\n4250 shares at $23.32\n\n40x $27 calls 7\/9\n\n10x $30 calls 7\/9\n\n(I do think PLTR will moon sooner, sometime within the week with enough attention but I don't want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out.

Same shit for palantir and a few other really popular growths.

        "77":"First let me start out by saying I'm an APE who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest, rarest, and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices. WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons.\n\nNow, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting...\n\n**PRICE ACTION** First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2\n\nAlso, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low.\n\n**FIBS** This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the \"Golden Trade\". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6\n\n**OPTION VOL** Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138\n\n**PC RATIO** Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d33w9csi6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a5cfbbd65b91f320a5577194e229b049ca6d48\n\nIf you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see \"BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP\" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history. This cannot go tits up ;) Not financial advice don't wanna get sued. I'm gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at Arby's is almost over.",

        "80":"Greetings, honourable intellectually gifted fellow WSB participants. It\u2019s crayons drawing Roman here, and this time I brought you a fascinating technical thesis I would like to hear your opinion about!\n\nImportant notice to be made: this is a motherfucking super duper risky play, and you will most definitely lose a lot of money, if not all, if you follow it, especially via FDs. So don\u2019t fucking follow it, you fucking donkey! Rather, treat it as a technical hypothesis, or a fun TA brain candy - and tell me what you think, I\u2019d like to gather some sweet retarded feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kjo0vjdoah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c8a2e3bcc54035412afdb6ea5cba9d21f91e31c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2ubr6zypah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38830e5af516fe0ab5d8c9f6824f91d6f0a6bd65\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n\nAs you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it\u2019s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n\nSo far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.\n\nAnother thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.\n\nAnd the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).\n\nOverall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?\n\nLove you and fuck you with all of my heart,\n\nRoman, aka TA degenerate.\n\nOh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fgyr3zhah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4701c608c386223824d143c9e254d858894db33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sxymaf3kah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f876de00fb46e79f783756ab5bd7b0fe6f41f0f3)",

        "89":"The surge of trading in offbeat stocks is duping inexperienced investors in to high costs and a battle with Wall Street that they cannot win, according to the founder of one of the largest trading firms in the world.\n\nZero-commission trading helps to build an illusion that amateur investors have never had it better, Alex Gerko, co-chief executive of London-based XTX Markets, told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nBut the way retail brokerages sell on their customers\u2019 orders and a \u201cvery poor benchmark\u201d mean that the smallest investors together shell out billions of dollars in hidden costs every year when buying or selling US equities, he explained.\n\n\n\u201cThe GameStop episode made it obvious that the retail part of the market is particularly broken,\u201d Gerko said, referring to the huge spike in the console store chain\u2019s shares in January. \u201cThe incentives are there to create a lot of churn in very illiquid stocks, which is exactly what we are seeing this year.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, the GameStop frenzy was an unprecedented victory of young amateur traders over Wall Street professionals including some hedge funds that had been betting against the company. But Gerko thinks the reality is the opposite. \u201cIf you think of zero commissions, on paper it sounds great \u2014 trading was expensive and now it\u2019s free. That\u2019s obviously complete nonsense,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of the allure of retail platforms such as Robinhood is that they provide zero-commission trading. But Gerko said charges are hidden in the difference between the buy and sell price, the so-called spread, meaning brokers and market makers want clients to trade shares where this gap is widest, such as in illiquid stocks that are generally thinly traded.\n\n\u201cIf a market maker earns a certain spread from retail flow, and then pays some percentage of that spread to the retail broker\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009you end up with a perverse incentive to ensure that the end clients trade stocks with very wide spreads,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 41-year-old mathematician\u2019s criticism comes as shares in cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other meme stocks, popular with retail investors in online forums such as Reddit, are soaring once again. AMC shares have jumped by more than 500 per cent in the past month to last week\u2019s highs before moderating, gaining a further boost after the company promised retail investors additional perks \u2014 including free popcorn.\n\n\nGerko said brokerages and other intermediaries are among the beneficiaries of these share price pops, particularly as retail brokers often sell their clients\u2019 trades in bulk on to market makers, which then aim to secure favourable prices for clients. This practice, known as \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d (PFOF), earned US brokers $2.9bn in 2020 without charging amateur investors commission up front, and has attracted attention from regulators.\n\n\u201cIn the current ecosystem there is somehow enough\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [to] leave market makers with billions of dollars of revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where does this money come from? The retail investors. When people are claiming that they provided X billion dollars of price improvement last year, the question is whether any of that price improvement is real. And whether it\u2019s something they should be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe Russian-born UK citizen started his career as a currencies trader at Deutsche Bank. In 2015, he set up XTX Markets and built one of the largest computer-driven trading firms in the world. He has kept a low profile while amassing more wealth than some household names. Last year he contributed more to the UK\u2019s tax coffers than the Duke of Westminster, according to the Sunday Times, making him the 13th largest individual taxpayer in the country.\n\nHis firm does not employ human traders but relies purely on computer models to buy and sell assets in a bid to generate profits. It does not engage in payment for order flow. The firm is the third largest dealer in global currency markets and handles 13 per cent of European equities traded on exchanges. Since 2019, the company has also been in US stock markets.\n\nA recent paper from consultancy BestX Research said price improvement on retail market orders averages about 25 per cent, compared with the standard benchmark. But the paper added that this in reality was \u201cakin to getting a 30 per cent discount on an item after the shopkeeper raises the price by 40 per cent,\u201d because the benchmark covers only a small slice of the market.\n\nBroker Robinhood and the two of the largest US market makers, Citadel and Virtu, have defended the PFOF model, arguing there is no evidence that payment for order flow harms investors. But newly sworn-in chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, has said he would make the PFOF model a focus of future work.\n\nGerko said one solution could be to strip PFOF out of the process, and instead to feed retail traders\u2019 orders on to exchanges where they would match off against each other or market makers would compete to execute the deals. He also bats away criticism that his proposals are self-serving, noting that XTX advocates for market structure changes in all markets, even where they play a dominant role already, such as currency markets.\n\nEven with those kinds of changes, however, he doubts that retail investors can emerge victorious from another round of battle with sophisticated trading firms. \u201cRetail investors have managed to cause some pain to one hedge fund. I can assure you in the long run it won\u2019t be retail participants winning this game, that\u2019s just impossible.\u201d\n\nSource: Retail frenzy reflects \u2018broken\u2019 US equity markets, says XTX\u2019s Gerko https:\/\/on.ft.com\/3cq2h3u \n\nFree to read",

The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r\/wallstreetbets.\n\n\nSince December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray\u2019s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%.

Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray\u2019s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.\n\n\nHedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray\u2019s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). \n\n\nNonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. \n\n\nThe only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?\n\n\nSource : You can read more detail in [this article](https:\/\/buymyweedonline.com\/marijuana\/how-the-reddit-effect-has-impacted-cannabis-stocks\/)",
        "94":"So since we\u2019re rolling into the weekend I figured this would be a good time to learn a little about the journey some of us have been on the past year or so. I\u2019m sure everyone has a unique personal story of their financial journey throughout this past year or so. I\u2019d love to hear some of the fucking disasters you bulls\/bears\/apes have gotten yourself into as well as the successes. I\u2019m sure mine is mildly entertaining compared to many but I\u2019ll start us off. \n\nOriginally started investing in 2019. I sold all of my positions before the Covid crash last spring (only trading stocks, was up over 100% on my portfolio in approx 6 months which I know is peanuts compared to the gains many have but I was proud of myself for just starting out and mostly swing trading boomer shit) which turned out to be an amazing decision except for the fact that I did not reinvest any of it during the massive March dip. Like many I was stuck in a whirlwind of uncertainty and did not know if society would ever return to normal. So I did the rational thing you would do with your gains. I spent it on drugs and alcohol, and paid off my car note so I could trade my Acura in for my dream car. I bought an Audi s8 which is a car I wanted since I was a teenager. It was fucking amazing, I couldn\u2019t believe it was mine (the banks) and I got to drive that shit around every day. I swear to god I will hit 100mph every single time I got behind the wheel of that car. Even if it was just to run a couple miles up the road to the gas station. My car note was insane, between the payment and my insurance I was paying as much to have that car as I was for my rent each month. It took up a big portion of my disposable income so I stayed away from investing until about August of 2020. I took what was left in my savings account after all those bad decisions and decided once again to jump back into the market. The September tech stock crash pretty much wiped me out and I cut my losses and walked away with a fraction of the money I started with. The next month I crashed the shit out of my Audi. She had no chance with me as the owner. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because guess what boys, I can now take all the money I was putting into my car (which was waaaaaay out of my league by the way) and invest it. I came up with a monthly budget and by Nov 2020 I was back in the trading game. I spent literally hours each day researching and learning as much as I could. I figured out my swing trading style, had a solid game plan going into each trade, and was making bank. Bank for me anyways. All through Nov and Dec I was making more money swing trading stocks each day than I do at my full time job. I felt like Warren fucking Buffet. \n\n*GME enters stage left\n\nJanuary. Mothering fucking January. Over the course of the couple months prior I had built up a nice little chunk of change for myself and had a portfolio to be proud of. This is when I decided to yolo on GME. Did I buy at $10 or $20, or even $30? No, of course fucking not. I started buying that shit in the $70s and before you knew it I had a triple digit average and had unrealized daily profit that exceeded what I make in a month at work. Oh, BB and AMC are squeezing this month too? Sure I\u2019ll take some of those. Fast forward about a week and I\u2019m selling at a loss and have less money than I had started with in November. I could have secured profits but no. A week of investing in GME had erased all of my fundamentals and made me abhor the color green apparently. Here I am five months later and I\u2019ve barely clawed my way back to breaking even on the cash I initially invested. \n\nDid I swear off meme stocks after this cataclysmic failure of investing? You bet your ass I did. Did I try to swing trade GME again a couple weeks later with some fresh powder and lose even more money? You should know the answer to that at this point. Despite my constant tribulations did I once again buy AMC and BB this week? Of course I did you sexy animal. So here I stand before you today, a full on retard that barely learns from his mistakes. I\u2019d love to hear some of y\u2019all\u2019s investing stories from the past year.  \ud83d\ude18",

My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35\/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5\/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?

Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 \/ 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**",
        "97":"Everytime Gme starts to squeeze again, all of the sudden all of these other \"meme stocks\" start trending and being promoted as the next short squeeze candidate. Amc, BB, Nio, etc. I can't prove it, and maybe I'm just retarded, but I feel like maybe it's a divide and conquer type deal. It's a lot easier for hedge funds to stave off a massive squeeze, if everyone is putting their money into other stocks instead of concentrating on the one that got us all here. Maybe they're using other meme stocks as a hedge against GME. Like buying calls on stocks like AMC, and then promoting them as the next GME, then when everyone buys into AMC or whatever the new hot stock is, they then have more money to cover their shorts on GME. I know it's a crazy theory, but it just seems odd that everytime the squeeze is initiated, all of the sudden there are numerous other \"squeeze candidate stocks.\"",
        "98":"Workhorse Group (WKHS) As of today, it is shorted at nearly 42% of float. This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. \n\nBoth GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.\n\nToday, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. \nEdit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.\nEdit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would've contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I've found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post. This is the most up to date and accurate info I can seem to find.\n\nI expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.\n\nWKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15\/share currently.\n\nThoughts?",
        "99":"All right, listen up you fucking idiots. Here's some dd that this dumpster fire of a sub doesn't even deserve. You're making money right now on $GME, $AMC, $BB, or whatever. Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. \n\n\nThe company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.\n\n\n--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------\n\nEven though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and\/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I\u2019ve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I\u2019m mentally retarded.\n\nEven though you morons can\u2019t read, have your wife\u2019s\/gf\u2019s boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (\u201cdEcAde\u201d is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the \u201ctransition\u201d fuel between dirtier energy sources and \"green\" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. \n\n\nAre you following?\n\n\nWhat's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically \u201cconcentrating\u201d it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It\u2019s much more expensive for them to produce than the US.\n\nWhen a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a \u201czone\u201d is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth\u2019s surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.\u2026 What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150\/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)\n\nIf these costs aren\u2019t too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can\u2019t afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just \u201cflare\u201d the gas. Just the \u201cflare\u201d vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It\u2019s like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that\u2019s for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend\u2019s birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It\u2019s an amazing sight.\n\n\u00ad---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------\n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You\u2019d have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you\u2019re a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. \n\n\n\n-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------\n\nCharif Souki started Tellurian. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80\/share. \nHe was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren\u2019t sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. \n\nTellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It\u2019s mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.\n\nDo you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.\n\nSouki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki\u2019s predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer\u2019s words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video \u201cwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.\u201d I assume this is his way of telling us \u201cbuy in now you fucking retards\u201d without being fined by the SEC.\n\n------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------\n\nTHE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT\u2019S 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. \n\n\n---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------\n\nAt the VERY VERY least, I\u2019m betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11\/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.\n\n\n\n------------------------------PROOFS----------------------------------lll--------\n\nA screenshot of the rig reports showing Tellurian\u2019s activities\u2026..\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/hw7kJuy\n\n\nTl;dr - undervalued company with no debt and unlimited potential in energy industry with a middleman position to the transition to clean energy WITH SHORT POSITIONS about to lift off.

You can find last weeks post [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nj7tco\/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and\/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   \n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)\n\nOverall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford\u2019s F150 lightning. \n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  \n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.\n\n**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** \n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)\n\nNo points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company\u2019s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.\n\n**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO\u2019s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https:\/\/investorplace.com\/2021\/05\/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation\/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.\n\n**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don\u2019t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\n**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance as of 5\/14\/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is:\n\nGME - 29.34%\nAMC - 21.13%\nBBBY - 64.38%\n\nBBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play.\n\nUnfortunately, the analysts don\u2019t have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5\/28\/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4\/21\/2021. I suspect Morningstar will come out with an updated report in the near future. CFRA rates it as a sell with a target price of $16 in a report published on 5\/29\/2021.

        "108":"**1: Amazon wants to open up physical stores to sell over-stocked computer equipment from their warehouses. Gamestop has suitable locations for them all across the country to do so.**\n\nAmazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store)\n\nAnd if you're paywalled out here's a couple others that should do the trick:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4)\n\n[https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362](https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**\n\nDue to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): \n\nChief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke \n\nChief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens\n\nChief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**\n\nMany people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails\n\nHow does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**\n\nBetween developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**\n\nBeing able to shift the news narrative from \"Amazon kills unionization attempts\" to \"Amazon saves \\~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop\" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple recent articles about Amazon:\n\nFrontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt\n\n[https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA NYT article titled \"How Amazon Crushes Unions\"\n\n[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**\n\nNow that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.\n\nElon & Jeff have been rivals for years:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7)\n\nPlus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P\/E Ratio**\n\nBuying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P\/E ratio). As of 5\/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5\/28\n\nHaving a P\/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P\/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P\/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",

After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions\n3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions\n4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions\n5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%\n6.

The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.\n.\n.\n\u201cAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,\u201d Cramer said.\n.\n.\nDespite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC \u2014 which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming \u2014 is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.\n.\n.\nBut Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.\n.\n.\nShorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.\n.\n.\nWhen the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.\n.\n.\nBoth GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That\u2019s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower, but they\u2019ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.\u201d\n.\n.\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower\u2026\u201d\n.\n.\nI believe Cramer has never met the INTERNET!!!!!!",

Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n\nCongrats to AMC hodlers, but today we\u2019ll take a look at the superior stonk\u2018s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n\nThe first thing to take a look at this [GME](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action\u2018s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF\u2019s GF\u2019s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n\nMACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n\nAnd the most important factor to \ud83d\udc3b in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n\nI hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! \n\n(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",

That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.\n\nAnd it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January.

Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.\n\nHow can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.\n\nThink about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company?

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.\n\nOh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!\n\n(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche\u2019s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.\n\nAs the general public was finding out about Wendysking\u2019s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen\u2019s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/dpnzup\/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant\/):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.\n\nWhat is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn\u2019t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3w0ajhk1f2z61.jpg?width=1722&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4d29a8a0c5ccacfdd193f3e2d5100d0cfdee74b\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**\n\n[VWSS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)\n\nEven though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement \ud83c\udf08tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support\/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.\n\nIn the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance\/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.\n\nOne may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it \"**Purple Haze**\".\n\nLet's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the \"**Squeezy Grail**\", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \\[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the \"**Runway**\"), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular \"**Squieezluminati Confirmed**\" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.\n\nEspecially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal \ud83c\udf08 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.\n\nNot only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).\n\nPay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*\n\nNoice, but let's move further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly \u201cis become meme, Destroyer of shorts\u201d: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company\u2019s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.\n\nRemember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla\u2019s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla\u2019s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:\n\n>The longest unprofitable short I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk\u2019s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':\n\n[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!\n\nLooking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \\[important!\\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?\n\nAnd the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.\n\nCurrent TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.\n\nToo many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u\/roman_axt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome additional food for thought from TSLA:\n\n[For redditors with a different floor](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:\n\n[GMESS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u\/ControlTheNarrative, at least.\n\nAnd so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.\n\nThen, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.\n\nFibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.\n\nIdentifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:\n\n[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy? Because this                        \u261d\ufe0f is clearly where the fun started.\n\nAnd now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time.

GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions.

Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. \n\n**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. \n\n**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. \n\n**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. \n\n**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.

David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  \n>  \n>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\\[1\\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \\[2\\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \\[3\\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don\u2019t you start.  \n>  \n>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  \n>  \n>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  \n>  \n>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  \n>  \n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I\u2019ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  \n>  \n>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  \n>  \n>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \\[those\\] relationships.*  \n>  \n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>My time is coming done. *How are you going to solve this? Do you feel that we can so we don't have any more of this Gamestop?*  \n>  \n>\\[Chair Gensler was directed to respond in writing to that question because the time was up for Rep.

        "127":"Hello everyone,  \nthe price of the GameStop stock (GMEUSD) finally broke out of a sideways movement and is currently looking for new highs ($185.00 at this moment) in the pre-market. We are looking forward to the US market opening in \\~4 hours. In order to be prepared for the undergoing trend-change, we are going to have a quick look on the chart.  \n\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.tradingview.com\\\/x\\\/Bbhn1dBH\\\/](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1i18187enov61.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0b6345d359ec3fdb37790c3ea59a4b03438956)\n\nThe full chart is visible [here](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bbhn1dBH\/). We can see that the price was accumulating in a symmetrical triangle from March to this date. As soon as the price is hitting the demand zone (red channel), we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape.  \nThis is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume).  \n\n\nNow we're looking at a change of structure\/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action.  \n\n\nBuyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high.  \nThis upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.  \n\n\nHave fun trading apes!",

        "130":"Hi Fam, its me, Fam. \n\nThere is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**\nThis is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting\/elliotwave. \n\nRefer to this image first : https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CR0OiQJ.jpg\n\nFrom a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) \n\nRefer to image: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cw86Lhx.jpg\nThis image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). \n\nOn the daily,\n* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start\n* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves\n* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. \n\nIf this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. \n\n TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. \n\nIm not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think.

Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.

If you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that it's not going to drop to $50 overnight as CNBC would have you believe.  They parade idiots on their shows as Analysts (aka experts).  Keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value.  Same for most people.  You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b\/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.  Gamma pressure easier to manifest.  If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.\n\nEveryone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.

Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.\n\n\\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$\n\n\\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!\n\n\\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.\n\n\\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.\n\n\\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.\n\nPlease have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.\n\nTL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",
        "133":"My medium-term bull case for MVIS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n3 GME @ 238\n\n500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg\n\n\\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets do some quick and dirty math.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor our purposes we will use May 21 exp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \\~193% current price)\n\nMVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \\~182% current price)\n\nRKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \\~136% current price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium \/ stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME: 5.387%\n\nMVIS: 7.273%\n\nRKT: 1.182% (IV is \\~60%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \\*bought\\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so let's talk potential gains and losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5\/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high.

I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting.

        "135":"In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  \nI have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.\n\nMy fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1\/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).\n\nAnd yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).\n\n**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41\n\nThe story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!\n\n# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly\n\nThe story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: \"A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return.\" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?\"**\n\nYou are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.\n\n**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65\n\nHowever, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170\n\n, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there\u2019s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: \"STONKS ONLY GO UP\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?\"**\n\nYeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2\n\nI am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:\n\n**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? \ud83d\udc3b with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.\n\n**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?\"**\n\nPuts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!\n\n[\\\\\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\\\\" - Wen Moon.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!\"** \\- an ape.\n\nThat's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \\[big part of the revenue\\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:\n\n[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)\n\nAs you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.\n\nAs it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?\n\nThey dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1\n\nAnd soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?\"**\n\nEverything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!\n\nBy buying a big stake of GME \\[12.91% currently\\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.\n\n[Many, but not u\\\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)\n\nIt is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, \u2018traders\u2019 and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X\/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a\n\nWhen a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?\"**\n\nDafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  \n\n\n# shortz r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.\n\nApemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.\n\n**\"shortz r lit, hOew can i yoYO my BandaNas ape wAnt SHArT seLl stuCk?**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82\n\nOh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. \ud83d\udc3b with me, this is the most interesting part.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7\n\nRemember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.\n\nFor now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae\n\nFurthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. \u0421ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.\n\nFurthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?\n\nMore than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?\n\n**TL; DR:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fsbyxzcqxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca3cd574a007fa611a3ca3a95dae07cb24f6a613\n\nMeanwhile...  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801",

        "139":"# What Motivates an Ape\n\nI started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. \n\nI wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.\n\nI've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses\/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. \n\nFor this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization\\_of\\_all\\_open\\_option\\_contracts\\_on\\_gme\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme\/)\n\n# Comparing MSFT to GME\n\nMy presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).\n\n**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. \n\nIf you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** \n\n**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**\n\n[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\\\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)\n\nThe main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. \n\nFor sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  \n\n**No one is buying GME Options!!**\n\nIf you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)\n\nNotice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. \n\n**Implied volatility and why\/how thetagang makes money**\n\nImplied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. \n\nWhat is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. \n\nThis phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. \n\nThetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. \n\nImplied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f\n\nNotice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and\/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.\n\nUse the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).\n\n***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***\n\nPositions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both.

I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.\n\nEdit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.\n\nIf you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. \n\nEdit \\^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.\n\nAlso a tip, use the indicator \"Accumulation\/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically.

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.\n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*Edit\\* also see latest update (4\/1): [Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mi1a5r\/our_whale_is_suppressing_volatility_to_bleed_hfs\/)\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P\/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P\/S ratio (similar to P\/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P\/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P\/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P\/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P\/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P\/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P\/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories.

I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r\/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up?

If this doesn't work, I'll stay where I was at. Send me a message if you see this disappear.\n\nThank you all for your help! I didn't leave WSB on purpose, automod just doesn't like me.\n\nCurrent price: 223.61\n\n**12:26 Update**\n\nGME did break 220 again and has been hanging around 222. We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at.\n\nCurrent price: 224.04\n\n**11:31 Update**\n\nThank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing.\n\nI'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors.\n\nGME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving?\n\nCurrent price: 218.85\n\n**11:08 Update**\n\nTwo small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now.\n\nCurrent price: 215.96\n\n**10:40 Update** \n\nAnother attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket.\n\nCurrent price: 214.00\n\n**10:16 Update**\n\nWe're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub.\n\nThe attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory.\n\nCurrent price: 220.96\n\n**10:08 Update**\n\nThis isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in \ud83e\udd37.\n\nThey could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer.\n\nI'll look closer and keep y'all updated.\n\nCurrent price: 220.00\n\n**10:03 Update**\n\nGME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite.\n\nCurrent price: 219.14\n\n**9:41 Update**\n\nAfter a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum. If GME can hit a Gamma Squeeze threshold, today could be insane.\n\nWhere's that threshold? I'm sure there are some wrinkle brains here that can figure that out for me. If y'all can give me the proof, I'll post it here.\n\nCurrent price: 224.47\n\n**9:25 Update**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Premarket\n\nThis might mean a really strong start for GME.

I'm working on a solution over there and will let you know if I migrate there.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have candles or cups for you all. I know the standards here are pretty high, but I'm a smooth brained ape. I just hope that my removal from WSB doesn't cause undue panic.\n\nGME is officially green in pre-market. Let's see if this continues into opening bell.\n\nCurrent price: 214.00\n\n\n**8:20 Update**\n\nI'm making my own post in case this post gets removed in the WSB Megathread. If I can't make things work at WSB, I'll stay here again today.\n\nPremarket, GME has stayed steady. I don't see the type of attacks we saw yesterday premarket. That doesn't mean that things won't light up once markets open. \n\nCurrent Price: 203.01\n\n**8:03 Update**\n\nIt seems that my posts are still getting auto-deleted. I've removed all links.

I will transition this post to the GME Megathread when it comes up.\n\nPremarket shows a slight dip from close yesterday.

Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?",
        "150":"Hello there, fellow apes.\n\nI'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. \n\nI've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.\n\nFor example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:\n\n[https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)\n\nWhat bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.\n\nIs it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. \n\nAs far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.\n\nI mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.\n\nAnd no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)\n\nTL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.",
        "151":"I'M AN IDIOT. THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post. \n\n**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. \n\nSummary: \n\n1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. \n2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. \n3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. \n4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. \n5. The \"Minimum Exposure Point\" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wtv7voax6ln61.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=da76d255fa895d29b253b22187d781680d719708\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sqajs7507ln61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6dddca60e9be57c4e70d23bce73d221502ff961\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/deg196o37ln61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72bcf496a037322580e2d705680dab89db88a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5c3flv67ln61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f62411351adb0ce2224d22713f8c159797bb45\n\nLIMITATIONS\/WEAKNESSES\/BACKGROUND:\n\nThis is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor\/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?\n\nNote that this does not represent this market maker's \"loss.\" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.\n\nAlso, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing\/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.\n\nFinally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",

Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.\n\nEDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/dontkillchris\/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating.

My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!\n\nEDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as \"shorting\".\n\nEDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Nomadic8893\/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!\n\nEDIT 9\uff1aMy account has been ban for commenting (Weired)!

Stock price was \\~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \\~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money. So I really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this Friday, so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercised.If there's some Pro here who can clarify the MMs covering process I'd be grateful.",

Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.\n\nThink about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?\n\nThe little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair \"stock\" market and that anyone can become rich.\n\nI'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.\n\nThe thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.\n\nBut seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?\n\nHint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING\n\nNo matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.\n\n**Next my fellow retards,**\n\nHDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.\n\nNo time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\n\nRemember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.\n\nMy blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.\n\nI can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.\n\nTO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO. GAMESTOP WILL BE THERE.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso, here's a picture for those that can't read.

If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https:\/\/www.elliottwave.com\/Free-Reports\/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\".Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064\n\nImpulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf\n\nCorrective Wave on GME Daily Chart\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*\n\nSo you are telling me that fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...\n\nElliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.\n\nUnlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.\n\nAlready during our first \ud83d\ude80 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb\n\nScreenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January \n\nI shared that screenshot initially [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l4syrd\/gme_megathread_part_2\/gkqko9z\/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our \ud83d\ude80 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec\n\nWhat actually happened after that \"prediction\"?\n\nAs you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our \ud83d\ude80 take-off was canceled.\n\nIf you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.\n\nOK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?\n\nWell, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.\n\nHowever, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f\n\nUsing my new crayons on GME hourly chart.\n\nThe way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Pre-Launch\n\nNow, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction\/retracement\/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our \ud83d\ude80 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.\n\nNow, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the \ud83d\ude80 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",
        "158":"I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here\u2019s my update after today\u2019s fuckery. \n\nReal quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that\u2019s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I\u2019m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best\/expect the worst. This is why I\u2019m hype, take it or leave it. I also don\u2019t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.\n\nFirst, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That\u2019s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I\u2019m sitting there getting pissed off because it\u2019s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell\u2019s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn\u2019t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn\u2019t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.\n\nThe whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It\u2019s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It\u2019s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. \n\nHere\u2019s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we\u2019re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don\u2019t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That\u2019s my hope. Today\u2019s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won\u2019t. \n\nIf RKT can bounce back above 26 then we\u2019re right back in the game. Again, there really weren\u2019t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. \n\nIf the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That\u2019s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. \n\nLet\u2019s finish the week off positively. We\u2019re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it\u2019s undervalued as shit.",
        "159":"TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC\/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich\n\nI know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. \n\nAMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. \n\nHating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single \"retail investor\" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win\/squeeze, the entire economy\/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.\n\n Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. \n\nTo me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. \n\nSo support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME. \n\nApe together strong, but more importantly, Common people together, supporting each other, can change the entire world.",

        "162":"**TR;LD:** Institutions uses Alternative Trading (ATs) mechanism called Traderbots (HFT, high -frequency trading algos) to insert large positions in the markets using dark pools (hidden positions). Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows \u201dnaked shorting\u201d by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional \u201dnaked shorting\u201d when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. \n\n\n\n**How does this happen?**\n\n\nAlternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. \n\nThe reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. \n\nAt first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of \u201dblock transactions\u201d around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as \u201d*toxic*\u201d market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of \u201cblock transactions,\u201d where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.\n\nThere is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.\n\n_**Here is Barclay\u2019s disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:\n\n\u201c*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, \u201c[n]one of which*,\u201d recalled one Director, \u201c*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*\u201d Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.\n\n*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*\n\n\n_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_\n\na) front-runs transactions, \n\nb)  void regulation, \n\nc)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), \n\nd) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, \n\ne) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),\n\nf) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.\n\n*Does that sounds familiar???*\n\nA lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and \u201dtimes and sales\u201d charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.\n\nThe author of the paper went a step forward saying that \u201dATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. \n\n**How is this becomes illegal?**\n\n\u201dIf dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.\u201d\n\nWhen a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it\u2019s intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. \u201dnaked shorting\u201d sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator\u2019s books (not sent to NSCC\/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It\u2019s one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.\n\n**Why is important to understand this?**\n\n\nThis process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every \u201dfail to deliver\u201d the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.\n\nIf you having read it yet, [check this](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)  from u\/gafgarian\n\nAs long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market. It's a matter of who gets tired first.\n\n\nThe tendies are coming, buy and hold \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\n\n\n*I am not an expert, I am sharing what I learned.

While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.\n\nShares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock\u2019s one-year low of $2.57.\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron\u2019s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.\n\nDusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.\n\n\u201cGME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,\u201d Dusaniwsky added.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop\u2019s parabolic ascent.\nGameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.\n\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.",
        "166":"So Ryan Cohen originally purchased his 12.9% stake in Gamestop at $8.43 per share average.  Based on the current price, this is about a 2300% profit.  \n\nPer his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.\n\nSo let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3\/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3\/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.  Thoughts?\n\nNot financial advice, I like the stock.",

        "171":" \n\n*Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again. I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog. Also due to wsb guidelines, i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap. Please bear with me (not the \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08)***\n\nAnyone questions? Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)\n\nHedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking\n\n*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*\n\n**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.\n\n**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:\n\n1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.\n2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.\n\n**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.\n\nIn a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.\n\n**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**\n\nNow I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*\n\n***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending.

They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.\n\n**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.\n\n**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.\n\nThe Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's\n\nETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.\n\n**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase\/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF's being shorted in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. \n\n**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**\n\nWhen faced with \"excessive buying\" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as \"Naked\" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP\/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are \"making markets\" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**\n\n**Can't stop, won't stop.

        "172":"So I was surfing the 3\/19 option chain for GME Friday mid-day when 3\/12's were about to expire and noticed some sizable volume well over open interest in the 195 and 200 puts.  (I later saw some lesser volume higher at 230 put strike.)  Obviously were some new contracts getting written at the 195 level.\n\n[3\\\/12\\\/2021 about mid day in 3\\\/19 contracts \\(Open Int. far right, Volume 2nd from right\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cqwutaavkan61.jpg?width=1369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b2dc9bef6439fcf5cddba083bcde66065402f7)\n\nSo I Youtubed bearish put straddles Friday night and mused the aim was to write the contracts for the funding to push the price down to the 230 range the next week.  Not to the levels of the price on the contracts of 195-200.\n\nSo I wasn't appalled this morning on coffee break when I saw the big drop.  Here's a snapshot of the option prices after the drop.

We are supposed to be controlling the value as shareholders. \n\nWhat do fundamentals mean anymore? Look at Tesla. You can\u2019t go by fundamentals alone.

        "175":"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.\n\nObviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.\n\n**First, the comment as it was:**\n\n*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.\n\nHolding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.\n\nIf you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).\n\nIf you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*\n\nEssentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. \n\n1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.\n\n2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.\n\nSo what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months\/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* \n\n#Volume\n\nWithout volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.\n\nThis thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation\/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.\n\nNow this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.\n\n#Options\n\nThe other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.\n\n1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.\n\n2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.\n\nYou can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.\n\nIf, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:\n\n1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.\n\n2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.\n\nNot only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.\n\nIf you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.\n\nTl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16",

EXPECT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO! \n\nIf this was poker, we are literally showing our hands before we go all in.

So let me end this retardness\n\nYes, I joined Reddit 41 days ago. The same day Mark Cuban came here to chat with us. I like some apes here bought GME in January out of fomo. I saw the stock go up and then crash down to the 50s. I\u2019m usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to \u201cget rich quick.\u201d When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to \u201cHOLD!\u201d I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I\u2019ve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it\u2019s much much more. It\u2019s NOT about ME, it\u2019s about \ud83e\udd8d. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn\u2019t agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you\u2019re just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I\u2019m trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there\u2019s more than one way to help the cause than buying.\n\nSo some of y\u2019all can continue to criticize me, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to continue to help and educate others.\n\nFinally if that story isn\u2019t convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. \n\nHopefully that convinces the naysayers that I\u2019m a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d!",

When GME dropped to less than 50 only a week after record highs, I knew things were not over. So I bought in and have been happily watching the gains these past few weeks.\n\nThing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say \"would have been\" because I did not buy that option. Not because I didn't want to, but because I wasn't ALLOWED to do so. What gives? The little guy can't get access to real trading strategies? Wall Street has to screw us over like that?\n\nI mean hey, I understand having to ask for approval first. Accept the risks and all that. So fine, I did that. Robinhood gave me a big FU. Fidelity, which has been my brokerage app, said I needed to wait a few days. On Friday I was told I got approved. Awesome. All good now, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm a little guy, so the only position I am entitled to is being screwed.\n\nThis week I decided to start small, grab one Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 200 in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22.

        "181":"Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post).\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.\n\n\"BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1\"\n\nWell, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.\n\nNow that the captain is gone, let's get to business.\n\n[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)\n\nI know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  \nWhat you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  \nThat was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v5s6clts12n61.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7e6dcacd9509becc15e1e38a254575986e49063\n\n\"Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON?1!\"  \n\n\n[Here you go boy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0u97sfv12n61.jpg?width=461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d64f1f93399d094112b49cf4170475e56ce84bc8)\n\n  \nAllrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.\n\n[Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mfnkdif022n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2fd1b92e9a7bf6c2bbeb0fac0ed538ea35d96b)\n\n1 = flat line;  \n2 = small magenta hill;  \n3 = line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit;  \n4 = accelerection;  \n5 = your brain (aka Gap);  \n6 = Valhala REKTangle \/ GME go BBBBRRRRRRR  \n\n\nGood boy\/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.\n\nOk, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.   \n\n\n[In-depth fractal forecast](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/888zsh3c22n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2c553761a27dc98efa7dae3de918da0d4f600f)\n\nI hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  \n\n\nI hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  \n\n\n[GME price action 22-27 January](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)\n\n[GME price action 5-15 March](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m1dydccm22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724902e12d23390a6f614fe026acd4f2c4abf3d)\n\nBecause they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.\n\nTL;DR: Fractals is life fractals is love  \u2764\ufe0f  as is GEEEMEEE",

That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020.

Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12\/31\/2020)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\\/\\\/www.nasdaq.com\\\/articles\\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1\/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own\/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.\n\nEdit: \/u\/alice_oe made this data point \u201cI use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.\u201d \nHeavily supports my points made, felt like it\u2019s important.",

Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I\u2019m proud of you \ud83d\udc8e hands that held through Wednesday. \n\nI believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3\/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. \n\nIn reviewing all the DD, I\u2019m really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. \n\n1. I\u2019ve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.\n\n2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who\u2019s teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn\u2019t Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!\n\nSee y\u2019all on the moon!

I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.\n\nBut the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it.

Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.\n\nAsk yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.\n\nThere is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).\n\nThey're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.\n\nThis strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.\n\nWhat's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.\n\n[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m35u61\/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th\/)\n\nThis attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.\n\nIf you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down.

This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.\n\n**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**\n\nAs the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.\n\n\\*\\*TLDR:\\*\\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time.

But most importantly - I\u2019m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn\u2019t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used the following parameters:3\/1 to 3\/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not.

So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.\n\nThere was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3\/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you\u2019re reading this btw)\n\nOn a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.\n\nSo wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value.

        "192":"I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual\u2019s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely na\u00efve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. \n\nI also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we\u2019re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don\u2019t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don\u2019t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don\u2019t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. \n\nThere are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don\u2019t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).\n\nMy point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you\u2019re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. \n\nThree years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You\u2019re telling me that these dumb hedgies can\u2019t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. \n\nGME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. \n\nThink about it...their argument is don\u2019t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It\u2019s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally.

        "193":"TLDR:Buy GME low, sell GME high. Get paid many times over the next year.\n\n\nMany a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.\n\n* Collusion!\n\nNo self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. \n\n\nMy first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, \"you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for...\" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, \"Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special\" \n\n\nMy second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. \n\n\nMy third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. \n\n\nIn conclusion\n\n\nThey are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.\n\n\nWhat do I know, I am an autist who is playing calvinball.

Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340.

I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the \ud83d\ude80 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing\/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options \"naked\" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.\nThis is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well.

        "202":"Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. \n\n1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you \" Go outside\". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.\n2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  \n\n3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was \" again?\". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.\n\n6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He\/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. \n\n7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. \n\n8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .\n\n10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills \" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.\"\n\n11.

        "203":" this is my take. the drop two days ago was actually done by the longs instead of shorties. They did it on purpose to trigger short restriction just for today. If you look at the put volume for today, $250 for sure has one of the highest volume. That's why after the drop it went right back to $250 and has remained stable yesterday. TODAY WILL BE FUN. AND THE LONGS BEHIND US ARE SMART AND POWERFUL. I do think the fundamental has changed for GME. Thats why the longs have to clear the shorts for the future of GME. IF you compare market cap, revenue, cash, debt etc between GME and chewy. I DONT think market cap of GME should be any lower than chewy.\n\n\\>$200 of GME seems high compared to last year.

        "206":"#How do you do, fellow investors?\n\n*obligatory: I eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice. if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here, expect to lose money. you have been warned.*\n\nLooking at the recent market shenanigans, the price action, you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this ex-blockbuster-esque company that ***I*** intend to own, aaand the way short sellers \/ big fish \/ hedgies are using GME to engage in their pissing contests... I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks\/months:\n\n- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as \"Absolute Unfair Horseshit\" to \"Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground\" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was \"playing nice.\" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.\n\n- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.\n\n- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1\/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).\n\n- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.\n\ntl;dr - Looks like it's just \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83e\udd8ds, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds \/ Whales now. Get ready for \"stagnation\" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.\n\nY'all win or I win. The only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers.\n\nSee y'all from the boardroom.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nedit: positions (currently holding both) - [1500 shares in RH; most recent update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m27s55\/gonna_own_gamestop_update_mar_10_2021_drop_the\/) | [60 shares in Fidelity; previous update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m0ycue\/i_will_own_gamestop_update_mar_8_2021\/)",

Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/2021\/02\/26\/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks\/\n\nI don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.\n\nPositions:\n5,000 Shares $CURLF,\n1,000 Shares GME,\n10 19 MAR @ $165 call GME,\n500 PYPL,\n10 JAN 23 @ $17 call SQQQ,\n200 Shares VOO  \n\nEDIT 1:  Some have pointed out $MSOS which is an ETF and you can trade options on.  I haven't fully looked into them but I think that any US based cannabis play is good.  My analysis up top I think points out why US based cannabis has a higher potential for explosive growth and a lot of the comments point it out as well.\n\nEDIT 2:  $MO (Altria\/Phillip Morris) owns logistics in this space and they already sell tabacco through multiple delivery methods.  They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends.  If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return.  MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P\/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P\/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends.  Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF\/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9).  With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive.  My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO.  I think $MO is the superior long play especially if they get out of debt.",

Do not let the highest highs and lowest lows consume you, stay in control. Many of those involved with $GME we\u2019re burnt out after the initial chaos. In some ways they we\u2019re lucky to recover an ounce of dopamine during the consolidation phase in Feb. But things are volatile once again (arguably also more defined) and the apes have something to live for once again. But understand the big players have vast resources to extend this course of history beyond what our feelings and intuitions can handle. Since the advent of the industrialized nation, that has always been the last yet most effective weapon in the arsenal of the powers that be - time. \n\nAdmittedly, this ape doesn\u2019t know much about stocks, but I do understand power. I can assure you they will drag this out in manners that DDs or financial experts cannot fully predict, within the market itself and from institutions outside of it. Prospect of tendies will be watered down and doubt will be sowed in the media and the mind of our ungrateful wives. Retail investors in $GME are playing a game of leverage with the Masters of Leveraging. And in this moment, it would seem the power of the many is outweighing the power of the few. Because of this, the rest of the world is rooting for you behind closed doors.\n\nAs it stands today, the stock has survived countless attacks from all sides. Victory seems afoot, hopes are high, and many can already taste the gourmet green crayons on their lips. But please remember that no matter your motivation, whether it be financial gain, vindictive positioning, revolutionary cause, or pure retardation, please do yourself and the stonK a favor and begin the process of accepting that you are playing the long(ish) game and it could be weeks or months before you finally get your dirty opposable thumbs on those earned tendies. And by god will we all have earned them all. If you begin to question the reason you started investing in $GME in the coming days, weeks, or months, you will fold and so will the stock.

Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. \n\nCohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can't sell easily as an insider).

The short sellers did cover most of their positions (140% SI is now 50% maybe, the author claims 30%). I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise (like 200%-900%) are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.\n\n(Edit: Even if SI is in fact high, this doesn't contradict the theory)\n\n# So GME is fucked if SI is low?\n\n**Not at all.** There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging. He's calling it a \"gamma swarm\" and it works like this:\n\n# Call sellers are going short, but not for long\n\nWhen you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised. That's it. If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.\n\nBut what if it goes up? Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract. With American calls this can happen at any time. With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date. That's the gamble when you sell call options.\n\nBig players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.** That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares. This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract. Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell \ud83d\ude80 calls to \ud83e\udd8d (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left. So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.\n\n# How long do they wait?\n\nFor GME? 1-5 minutes. That's wild.\n\n# How does this impact GME?\n\nAt the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10. That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.\n\nNow, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares. Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares. So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.\n\n# So, ultimately, what's happening?\n\nThe author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:\n\n\"This leverage has changed the game.

        "213":"These are my thoughts on a very solid article on the GME gamma squeeze which fits the available data well and shows a reasonable case for both correlation and causation between OTM call option buying and the stock price movements. It can be found here and has been doing the rounds on WSB:\n\n[https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/?sh=7314f9ff4225](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/?sh=7314f9ff4225)\n\nTo be fair, only apes, bagholders or the very inexperienced actually believed the reason was a short squeeze. You can't tell them that though no matter what evidence is given to the contrary. The gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility.\n\nHere are a couple of other thoughts I had while reading the article that support a very bearish case:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **A gamma squeeze needs at      least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising:**\n\n**a)** People buying OTM calls in very large volumes\n\n**b)** The stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock (or calls themselves, of different delta's and expiry's ) to re-hedge.\n\nThere are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions don't occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends - remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment - as it's clearly not fundamentals (it's a 15-25$ stock) or a short squeeze.\n\n**Here the issues with condition a)**\n\nLooking at the ATM weekly call 250$, expiring March 19, we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 (75$) giving a breakeven price at expiry ( not paying any attention to the other greeks. which given the theta decay and possible IV movements will hurt the buyer) of $325.\n\nThe 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ (4700$)giving a break even price of 397$.\n\nNow, the problem with this is simple: These very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford, even those well OTM. **Usually the retards might be able to afford a short term (weekly) OTM lottery ticket type option that you see yolo'ed here on WSB all the time, but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium (implied volatility) , the vast majority of apes are well priced out - a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys.**\n\nIn addition, IV has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days AND earnings is just two weeks away. IV typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings, so these calls will become even more expensive (even if no share price drop occurs). Ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of it's own success.\n\n**Here are the issues with condition b)**\n\nOf course, the share price is pretty volatile day to day so I'm not going to try to predict it, but I would note a couple of important points:\n\n\\- The share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze (see article) and once people realize this many who don't understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon. The holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or 'buying the dip\" (retailers volume is estimated to be around 1\/10th of institutions\/MM's\/quant funds\/ hedgies, most days at least) makes no difference - this isn't a short squeeze after all. Additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will ( see yesterdays 40% drop in 20 minutes) to suit their needs, and we don't know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock (short term algos) and so on. Maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls, but if they hold puts they will want it down. We simply don't know for sure, other than to note the current open interest put\/call ratio is around 3:1 - or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls.\n\nMore importantly for the share price to 'gamma squeeze' you NEED condition a) to be fulfilled. It is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy OTM calls on mass. This is not happening anymore.\n\n\\- Secondly, the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers (who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral) re-hedging their position. Again this poses massive risks for bulls, as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop. As the price drops those OTM and ATM calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value. Now if the price drops enough ( as an example if you bought just before the halt that ATM weekly (250 strike) call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$, a massive loss) the market makers will begin to re-hedge their risk in any of these ways:\n\n\\- Buy the call back for a significant discount ( or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay). This means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises.\n\n\\- Buy the now other (now) much cheaper calls\\* to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge\n\nNow, I've kind of skipped over the details here, but this is the essence of what should\/could happen. Now of course, those calls\\* themselves that are used to re-hedge will also have to be re-hedged by other market makers, but usually it's much cheaper to re-hedge a suddenly OTM call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta - it requires less purchase of the underlying. **So basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction - as the price drops, the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares, and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues.** It has similarities ( but is NOT the same -I'm not saying that at all) to a gamma squeeze, except now it's reversed, and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldn't be as violent. This is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited (stock price can moon indefinitely - in theory) and thus are riskier for market makers, but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze can't be sustained. This is due to market makers re-hedging ATM\/OTM sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price.\n\nWhatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly (hours\/days) especially once people realize what is going on.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nTons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expiry's 23-43 days out.\n\n**Edit**: A helpful person mentioned that I should have explicitly stated that you need **both extremely bullish ITM and OTM** call option activity to create a gamma squeeze. I totally agree and should have mentioned that.",

These are my thoughts based on the price action yesterday.\n\nSomeone made a shit ton of money from the drop.\n\nSo as most of you know a good deal of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying rolling forward as the price climbs, and subsequent MM delta hedging.\n\nSomeone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock. They then sold their puts off at the bottom.

        "217":"If you haven't read that Forbes article that came out today, you should. It's really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this GME growth, and why it will continue: www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/\n\nHowever, it also gave me an idea of what happened today and I want some feedback on the theoretical, and thoughts on why they wouldn't just keep doing this.\n\nThe article describes the price rise driven by the need for MM to cover calls. If they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock, that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered. After two weeks of heavy call volume, they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print. Let's say they're average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250.\n\nI don't understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose, so apologies if I'm drifting off base.\n\nSo if I'm sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and I know I can't stop the increasing price, why not flood the market with those million shares I have so the price plummets, and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering ITM calls? It would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls... Charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount.\n\nSo in this scenario, they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300, banking that $25 premium, but since they NEED those shares for delivery, and aren't willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed, they buy them back at an average of $225, $25 less than the average call strike.\n\nThey net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls. If they're smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis.\n\nSo... Can someone tell me why this wouldn't work? Or why it's probably not what happened. Because I'm sitting here, after the fact, thinking to myself, \"if I was an evil fuck, with loads of money to push shit around, and I don't want to lose  any of it, what would I do?\" And this is exactly what I would do.\n\nAnd if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened, what's to stop them from doing it every week? I know it doesn't hurt us financially (just psychologically) if we hold through it, but it will eventually scare more and more people away. What's the recourse? Anyone care to weigh in?",
        "218":"While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. \n\nConsider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \\~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nNow, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. \n\nRemember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, \"Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower.\" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \\~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42\/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.\n\nTL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k.

        "219":"Hey everyone! Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.\n\n- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.\n- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real \"smoking gun\". Some of the evidence has been:\n 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.\n 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/gqin9qf\/)\n 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.\n- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.\n\nThis is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!\n\nTLDR: HODL",

I am a nobody, and I can't give you specific dates to do anything. And following a rando internet dude is probably a bad idea. But I can say if you got some sense, you can \"tell\" when the right time to place your \"bet\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead the article and make up your own mind.

Keep strong my fellow apes, and Let's go to the moon! THIS WEEK WE WILL REACH THE MOON!**\n\nI've been holding positions in both stocks (AMC and GME) for more than one month, and I know more than one have already noticed this trend, but I wanted to post it here, so the people that haven't noticed can see it.\n\nAt the top you can see GME's charts, at the bottom AMC's charts, left side is ONE DAY chart, and right one is a ONE MOTNH chart. As you can see every time GME spikes or goes down, AMC follows, you can say, it is the market that is moving all together, but that is not true, I have position in other 10 stocks, and I have checked other stocks and I know for sure this cannot be just coincidence.\n\n**NOTE:** *Don't take my word as a financial advice, because it is not, I am not a financial advisor, neither a CAT, I just love both stocks so much that every hour of everyday I am looking at these charts.*\n\nEdit: Typos, and fixed format.\n\n[GME vs AMC Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mtjj15eibam61.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b8b026775ab1a55b93bcaccbb63a026805ba07)",
        "225":"Last week I drew out a chart looking like this\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/acopf56dr9m61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=921fe515d9d1fe8b49c7fc0ff410a016c0b3d5d6\n\nLets see the results...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4\n\nThe chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**\n\nWe have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.\n\n**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**\n\nWe established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.\n\nIf a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**\n\n***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***\n\n**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am just a retard who did some math and came up with random numbers",
        "226":"**TLDR:  $GME Volume during 12:20pm - 12:41pm crash indicates this was either a large  whale sell order (unlikely) or algorithmic short selling (likely). Keep  HOLDING!**\n\nJust like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n[$GME Daily Chart and Volume](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zq8ft5pm4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57cbbd3d5c04822441a1ffa5c3d3028b473eab5f)\n\nLet's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.\n\n[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)\n\nAs  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.\n\nThis points to two possibilities in my mind.\n\n**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**\n\nThe  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.\n\n**Possibility #2 (Likely)**\n\nThe  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember... ALL SHORTS MUST COVER!",

        "229":"So, on Monday I threw over $6k into GME 500 calls, expiring 3\/12.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday, I was up to $11K in the first hour of market open, but that dwindled away fast as the sideways movement yesterday killed the premium on the options. I was glued to my screen, and watched as each minute my balance fell more and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ar2bqghh0am61.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb49c7054a1051bd24c2675fe21a52dba4ee9f40\n\nThen today, I was initially down in the morning just for a minute but suddenly, things picked up big time. At 11:00AM, **I was up $32,000.00.** I currently owe about twice that in student loans, and I told myself I wouldn't sell until the options were worth what I owed in student loans (I refinanced my loans so they are now privately held, and thus I have no hope for forgiveness).\n\nThen, the GME drop and halts happened.\n\nMy $32,000.00 dropped to next to nothing in minutes.\n\nWhile a strike price of 500 for Friday is... doable, it's pretty fucking risky at this point. And with each passing day, the option premium drops significantly (theta at one point was like -4.2).\n\nSo, I waited a tiny bit  after the batch of halts (I was basically gambling yet again), and the options were finally about double the price I originally paid. I didn't want to be a slaughtered pig, and rather than focus on the $32,000.00 I missed out on, I realized I should be fucking happy I was able to get out with over $5,000.00 in profit.\n\nI had bought the contracts at an average of $4.8, and sold at $7.05.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[my closing trade](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rik4hsti0am61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=b630736ce7ed864584f6b97d30aada5d62bdb2fa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[final balance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xmchji0k0am61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b638cd70a4ef1ee9ef5a486eca966f6cce6608)\n\n**TL;DR: I don't have diamond hands, but I'm not ashamed.** I also am proud that my trade didn't have an impact on the hard work all you apes are doing in holding shares (since they are options contracts).

        "230":"Okay retards. Here is what I think happened today while you were busy shitting out the crayons you had for lunch. \n\nToday's GME dip was clearly a short attack. Most likely manipulation based on the sketchy timing of some articles, but my point is independent on that. I think as fucked up as it is to hear this, some hedge funds won on this one and that can even be good for us. Hear me out before you start screaming like the apes we are. \n\nFirst, there is absolutely no way retail had anything to do with this. We sure as hell  didn't cause such a strong dip by paper handling coincidentally all of us all of a sudden,  this was an orchestrated short attack. The interesting part was how it bounced back. And I believe that again there is no way retail had anything to do with it. How much money do we really have left to fight such an enormous dip at this point? We are balls deep in already. We apes keep saying to each other \"BUY THE DIP\" but let's face it, we ain't got no money left to buy the damn dip. We have put everything we have and beg our wife's boyfriend to give us some ramen noodles for dinner. \n\nSo here is what I think happened.\n\n1) Short attack by hedge funds which caused many stop losses to be activated. They then covered back that short attack, making gains from panicked day traders, stop losses, algos that started selling and paper handed bitches. \n\nOr\n\n2) The bounce back was again made by hedges, opposing ones this time. It's a war out of there and even though most hedge funds are owned and run by corrupt greedy douchebags, some of them are on our side, the long side of the trade. Or they have no skin in the direction of the game and simply like volatility. These are the ones that profited from today and fucked the shorts.\n\nSo what now my fellow gorillas? We view this as a good sign. Even if some hedge funds won, either the ones that shorted and profited like in case 1, or opposing hedge funds like case 2, what we want is high volatility. High volatility leads to more madness, more shorting and more chaos. This is what is gonna send us flying to the moon. We won't fly to Jupiter on a 5% day gain, we need the volatility. If you hate volatility go play boomer stocks.\n\n\nTLDR Hedge funds are most likely at war. High volatility is good for us. GME to the moon.",

I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.\n\nThat being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.\n\nThere's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.\n\nI'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nTruth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.\n\nSo what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.\n\nNot just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! \n\nYou know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.\n\nBased on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.\n\nFellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.\n\nNow...

This pictures the reason behind the blackout that is going on around the media: it can be very very dangerous (read interesting for us) if this thing gets the smallest bit of media focus because it will just fuel the biggest rocket launch in the whole security history.  Stay safe & Godspeed.",
        "236":"After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my children, then watching the 1971 movie, the GME events were predicted 40+ years ago.  I included pictures to help guide you along.  I hope this is helpful for you apes.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n\n* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor \ud83e\udd8d.  \n* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing \"Not-a-Cat\" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors \ud83e\udd8d of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab\n* Large corporations \ud83c\udfe2 buy large amounts of candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) \ud83c\udff0  is going to fail. \n* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets \ud83c\udfab in the candy \ud83c\udf6c they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.\n* With candy supplies \ud83c\udf6c being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs \ud83d\ude80.  Not liking this, the corporations \ud83c\udfe2 restrict limits on the amount of candy \ud83c\udf6c which can be purchased.\n* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket \ud83c\udfab has been found.  This sends the price of candy \ud83c\udf6c crashing.\n* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy \ud83c\udf6c increases. \ud83d\ude80  All this time, Charlie had \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.\n\n***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** \ud83c\udff0 \n\n* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.\ud83c\udf6b  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. \n* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry \ud83d\udd35, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.\n* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels \ud83d\udc3f opening the nuts \ud83c\udf30, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut \ud83c\udf30 opening squirrel \ud83d\udc3f instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut \ud83c\udf30 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.\n* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room \ud83d\udcfa, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High \ud83d\udcc8, Sell Low \ud83d\udcc9.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.\n\n***Other Characters***\n\n* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda \ud83c\udf7e.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda \ud83c\udf7e.  The soda \ud83c\udf7e causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.\n* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper \ud83c\udf6d.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?\n\n***That Scary River Scene*** \ud83d\udc79\n\n* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??\n\n***Conclusion***\n\n* In the end, Charlie held \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.\n\n\n\n***TL:DR;***  Charlie \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 crashed through the roof, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.  The others paper handed, tried to distract Charlie, and got roasted. \n\nThis is not financial advice.  This is not a movie review.  I am not a financial adviser.  I am not a movie critic.

        "237":"REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!\n\nAlso, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:\n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nFirst, let's look at the players involved here.\n\n# The shorts\n\nOn the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.\n\n# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)\n\nMarker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).\n\n# The longs\n\nOn the long side, we have you glorious apes  \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.\n\nNow let's look at the actions that have led up to this.\n\nIt all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.\n\n[Then some people liked the stock](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1p4up\/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme\/)\n\n[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m19sa7\/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be\/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.\n\n# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze\n\nSome people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).\n\nFirst, let's look at the option interest (source: [https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Strike|Open interest March 12th|Open interest 19th|Shares (combined 12+19)|Shares (combined 12+19 cummulative)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250|3231|2842|607,300|607,300|\n|255|563|0|56,300|663,300|\n|260|1047|542|158,900|822,500|\n|265|303|0|30,300|852,800|\n|270|788|748|153,600|1,006,400|\n|275|1386|0|138,600|1,145,000|\n|280|595|319|91,400|1,236,400|\n|285|303|0|30,300|1,266,700|\n|290|268|299|56,700|1,323,400|\n|295|323|0|32,300|1,355,700|\n|297.5|475|0|47,500|1,403,200|\n|300|7,011|5,389|1,240,000|2,643,200|\n|302.5|131|0|13,100|2,643,200|\n|305|276|0|27,600|2,683,900|\n|307.5|77|0|7,700|2,691,600|\n|310|660|307|96,700|2,788,300|\n|312.5|106|0|10,600|2,798,900|\n|315|683|0|68,300|2,867,200|\n|320|406|908|131,400|2,998,600|\n|325|313|0|31,300|3,029,900|\n|330|374|264|63,800|3,093,700|\n|332.5|130|0|13,000|3,106,700|\n|335|124|0|12,400|3,119,100|\n|337.5|48|0|4,800|3,123,900|\n|340|587|244|83,100|3,207,000|\n|345|622|0|62,200|3,269,200|\n|350|1876|2426|430,200|3,699,400|\n|355|122|0|12,200|3,711,600|\n|360|1151|344|149,500|3,861,100|\n|365|78|0|7,800|3,868,900|\n|370|103|351|45,400|3,914,300|\n|375|106|0|10,600|3,924,900|\n|380|290|396|68,600|3,993,500|\n|385|112|0|11,200|4,004,700|\n|390|354|508|86,200|4,090,900|\n|395|223|0|22,300|4,113,200|\n|400|3527|5156|868,300|4,981,500|\n|405|189|0|18,900|5,000,400|\n|410|173|258|43,100|5,043,500|\n|\ud83c\udf3f\u2697\ufe0f|605|1246|185,100|5,228,600|\n|430|211|130|34,100|5,262,700|\n|440|176|176|35,200|5,297,900|\n|450|558|604|116,200|5,414,100|\n|460|276|129|40,500|5,454,600|\n|470|215|210|42,500|5,497,100|\n|480|156|323|47,900|5,545,000|\n|490|166|314|48,000|5,593,000|\n|500|3,149|7,122|1,027,100|6,620,100|\n|510|259|496|75,500|6,695,600|\n|520|393|714|110,700|6,806,300|\n|530|252|168|42,000|6,848,300|\n|540|129|161|29,000|6,877,300|\n|550|490|1557|204,700|7,082,000|\n|560|198|218|41,600|7,123,600|\n|570|305|194|49,900|7,173,500|\n|580|94|615|70,900|7,244,400|\n|590|87|272|35,900|7,280,300|\n|600|1715|2065|378,000|7,658,300|\n|610|99|180|27,900|7,686,200|\n|620|117|153|27,000|7,713,200|\n|630|98|112|21,000|7,713,200|\n|640|326|250|57,600|7,791,800|\n|650|464|456|92,000|7,883,800|\n|660|320|147|46,700|7,930,500|\n|680|198|289|48,700|7,979,200|\n|700|1189|1264|245,300|8,224,500|\n|720|210|299|50,900|8,224,500|\n|740|307|239|54,600|8,330,000|\n|760|659|358|101,700|8,431,700|\n|780|1936|1060|299,600|8,731,300|\n|800|22,244|27,686|4,993,000|13,724,000|\n\nNow, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.\n\nAt some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.\n\nSimilarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.\n\nRemember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.\n\nYou can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.\n\n# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?\n\nSome people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).\n\nIn fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.\n\n# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:\n\n**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**\n\n~~Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in~~. That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant.",
        "238":"First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was \"our fault\". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.\n\nHedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.\n\nDeep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019\/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*\n\nSkip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**\n\nRyan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...\n\nExcept Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**\n\nSo what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.\n\nLet's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.\n\nLet's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.\n\nSo two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.\n\nLet's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.\n\n- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue\n- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue\n- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue\n- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue\n\nThere are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.\n\nUsing these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.\n\nHave I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.\n\nThen we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.\n\nOh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A \"Build-A-PC\" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**\n\n#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.\n\nBy the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**\n\nIf interested, I also did a rough analysis earlier on what the potential outstanding cost to fulfill call options are: [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1kvmx\/cost_of_shares_to_fulfill_open_call_options\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\n\n*This DD is based on information publicly available and my own interpretation of that information.

What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.\n\nAfter GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.\n\nFinally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products\/locations.\n\n# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...\n\nBut before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *\"short squeeze\"* and *\"gamma squeeze\"* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"short squeeze\" is when lots of people \"short\" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**\n\n**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"gamma squeeze\" happens when many people make lots of  \"call\" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**\n\n**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if\/when the call options can be exercised.**\n\n**If this high volume of \"call\" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SKIP POINT\n\n**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**\n\n# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.\n\n# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...\n\n**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**\n\n# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021\n\nWhat was once a $3-4\/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.\n\n# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.\n\nBefore more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous \"call\" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.\n\nAfter all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.\n\nIn less than a month, GME plummeted to $40\/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...\n\n# Yet this is not how GME ends.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.\n\nKeith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.\n\nDuring the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.\n\n**In other words, a \"short squeeze\" hasn't happened yet.**\n\nPeople found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.\n\nThey found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.\n\nNot only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.\n\nRyan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...\n\nThere were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games\/movies...\n\nPeople began exercising call options once more, and now...\n\n# The GME rocket rises once again...\n\n# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their \"call\" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.\n\n# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

        "245":"This is a continuation of a DDDD I wrote a few weeks ago about [how GME could cause a stock market crash](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l9sh9e\/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could\/) through mass de-grossing from short\/long Hedge Funds. However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nFirst, let\u2019s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.\n\n# What is Counterparty Risk?\n\nCounterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d in an obscure subreddit sent GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob\u2019s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.\n\n# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the \u201cSolution\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.\n\nTitle 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.\n\n# Why this doesn\u2019t really work\n\nWhat this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https:\/\/www.dtcc.com\/annuals\/2019\/financial-performance\/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they\u2019re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.\n\nThis is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can\u2019t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can\u2019t meet their margin call (aka your average [r\/wallstreetbets](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/) \ud83e\udd8d), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.\n\nSee, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that\u2019s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary \/ service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.\n\nSo what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven\u2019t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says\n\n* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses\n* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.\n* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.\n* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook\n\n# Tin Foil Hat Time\n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who\u2019s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.\n\nHowever, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I\u2019m too lazy to actually research this data, although I\u2019m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it\u2019s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.\n\nThis is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don\u2019t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there\u2019s so much volatility that it\u2019s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel\u2019s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they\u2019re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel\u2019s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.\n\nObviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.\n\n*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*",

THEN, I made 3 tables:\n\n* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.\n* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.\n* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d05jq0jx31m61.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1309f6e677e016ba1dbc04208dc8eb0b4ed665\n\nIN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.\n\nThe **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**\n\nIt is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.\n\nI believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe\n\nBecause you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.\n\nMy point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bfuqksue31m61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db05997bf1b3d2c6b909b8994888cab21464829\n\nNOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE.

If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.\n\n2 - Being impatientThis directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.\n\n3 - Not informing myself when to get in our outI always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.\n\n4 - Not checking out wsb (Not looking at who you're with)  \nThe most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub. All the memes made me strong, we are strong together. Believe it or not, those made me less stressed. I just didn't bother looking at who I was investing with. I'm a very inactive reddit user, usually.\n\nTL;DR: Don't panic sell, be patient, inform yourself and expect a falling stock once news make fun of WSB losses and check out WSB for memes to motivate you\n\nThank you dear apes for reading this.

        "256":"#  Intro\n\nWelcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.\n\n# Pivot Point\n\nThe pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**\n\nFor example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example Candlestick Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nR1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily Low\n\nR2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\nS1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily High\n\nS2 = Pivot Point \u2013 (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\n*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point \u2013 Daily Low)*\n\n*S3 = Daily Low \u2013 2 x (Daily High \u2013 Pivot Point)*\n\n**LINKING BACK TO GME**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME-\n\nResistance Line 1: $195.13\n\nResistance Line 2: 202.33\n\nResistance Line 3: 215.87\n\n*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**\n\n*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*\n\n# Relative Strength Index\n\n*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100\n\nRSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence\n\nAbove 70: Overbought\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)\n\nCurrent GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)\n\n*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*\n\n**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**\n\n**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RSI before jan squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRSI Value: 72.14\n\nAs seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.\n\n# Volume Weighted Average Price\n\nThe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.\u00a0*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**\n\n*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP March 1st-8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**\n* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.\n* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**\n\n# Moving Average Convergence Divergence\n\nMACD is a trend-following [momentum](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD january](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD march](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline.\n\n* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*\n\n# Other Indicators\n\nSince I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**\n\nAnyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix\/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving financial advice.

For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning\/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.\n\n\nFirst of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.\n\n\nMaybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.\n\n\nThis is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.\n\n\nCan't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves\n\n\nIf you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior, read this\n\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keynesian_beauty_contest\n\n\nIf you don't understand it, read again, this explains why you don't sell and you need to stick together",

        "264":"^(Disclaimer: No financial advise!)\n\nGood morning, good afternoon and good evening again my fellow retards around the world\n\nThis is a followup on my [previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lzsnlk\/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly\/), in which I already announced i would do one, if there are people actually reading my post. Hope you are still interested.\n\n**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**\n\n1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.\n2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u\/Calithrix](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Calithrix\/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.\n\n**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**\n\nSo lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u\/Natural\\_Profession\\_8](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Natural_Profession_8\/) [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/).\n\nAnd a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.\n\nAlso a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).\n\n**Some other requirements for a squeeze**\n\n* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:\n\n1. 03\/24 Earnings\n2. 03\/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)\n3. find other possible catalysts in [u\/HeyItsPixeL](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/HeyItsPixeL\/) post. (couldnt link cause of WSB guidelines but just look at his Endgame post with a lot of Upvotes)\n\n* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.\n* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.\n\n**Some final thoughts**\n\n* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.\n* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d with \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. \ud83c\udf1a\n\n**TLDR: MOON POSSIBLE BUT PROBABLY NOT THIS WEEK**",

So I started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in August and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much? I for the most part just passively observed it for a bit. Fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6% so I look at the stock and it dropped from 25.89 to 23.35 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted. [https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=UTZ](https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=UTZ) \n\nSo now that the short is over, I wondered if it is a good time to invest in it (my money is tied up in GME but if I had funds available) so I went to the call options to see what they had going on there and I found 7,347 call options for $30 a share as well as 1,092 @$25  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dxmqtgzl1ql61.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=25323fe4352551c8c05f4a8131e4573c24b80452\n\nso I think this is not a guarantee but I think it would be a good safe investment with almost immediate returns. plus there isn't too much risk because this company has been doing very well since it hit the market. \n\nThanks fellow apes, also GME \\*rocket noises\\* to the \\*monkey noises\\* moon",

The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.\n\n   \n \n\nThe writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.\n\n\nSOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?\n\n\n\nWell, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.\n\n   \n \n\nIts disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.\n\n   \n \n\nWhen corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.\n\n   \n \n\nNOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.\n\n   \n \n\nBut when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.\n\n   \n \n\nI don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.\n\n   \n \n\nBut dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.\n\n   \n \n\nI'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.\n\nI just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips.

Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the \"Your job is your credit\" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to take a family vacation.

And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.\n\n   \n \n\nWe SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?\n\n   \n \n\nWho are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?\n\nTruth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands.

        "267":"Good morning, good afternoon and good evening my fellow retards around the world.\n\nI know many of you are more like [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k77i69\/wsb_reading_citron_reports\/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.\n\n# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain \ud83e\udd8d)\n\nThere are two types of squezzes:\n\n* short squezze\n* gamma squezze\n\n**Short squezzes:**\n\nEvil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k9v5e9\/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am\/).\n\n**Gamma squezzes:**\n\nEvil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u\/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.\n\nWhat you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.\n\n# Applying this to the current GME situation\n\n**Short squezze:**\n\nIm sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).\n\n^(1: 01\/14\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n^(2: 02\/11\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n*\"But there was no volume?\".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.\n\n^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\n^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AMZN\/key-statistics?p=AMZN)\n\n*\"But what is with the institutional ownership?\"* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said \"Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest.\" (e. g. see [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz77ix\/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra\/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.\n\n^(5:) [^(Finra)](https:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)\n\nWith that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.\n\n^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https:\/\/etfchannel.com\/symbol\/xrt\/)\n\n**Gamma squezze:**\n\nA gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.\n\n*So how can \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u\/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lxkeg0\/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator\/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.\n\n^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS\/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)\n\n*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u\/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lycj6f\/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls\/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:\n\n>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  \n>  \n>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*\n\nSo these are probably numbers we need to see again.\n\n^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)\n\n*So whats the current situation with GME options?*\n\nFor the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.\n\n^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\\\/12](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)\n\nBut for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03\\\/19](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb)\n\nI may be adding some more analysis thoughts later.

        "270":"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue \/ cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.\n\nYou guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.\n\nI am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated \/ invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace\/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism \/ latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",
        "271":"TLDR: VW's squeeze was very different to the coming GME squeeze and people should be careful of some maybe false promises here. \n\nHello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up:\n\nJust recently one particular post\/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. \n\nYes but....WRONG! \n\nI don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you:\n\n(Translated from german Wikipedia):\n\n\"An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. [1] On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.\"\n\nIn Short:\n\nPorsche had 74,1%\n\nNiedersachsen (Lower Saxony - \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02), a \"state\" of Germany had 20%\n\nSo the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. \n\nWhat's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: \n\nThere are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price\/planned sell price\/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. \n\nThats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. \n\nTo give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. \n\nHowever I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$\n\nSince I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock!\n\n...Made 5k\u20ac at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100\u20ac \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\n\n...

While the Reporting Persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the Issuer, the Reporting Persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.\n\nGameStop\u2019s board was increased from 10 to 13 with Ryan and co. joining with plans to have a vote to reduce the board back to 9 seats.\n\n\nStart connecting the dots and I believe Ryan Cohen is taking the reigns.\n\n\n\nEdits and Sources:\n\n- Updated RC Venture\u2019s stake.

My wager would be on the former, but also the latter.\n\n**In any case, anyone who drops \\~$116M over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets. They have more money, that\u2019s a fucking fact.**\n\nCompound that with this buyer\u2019s breakeven at $124.01. **It logically follows, we have found our new BASELINE PRICE for GME.** Let me explain.\n\nConsider all this information with what happened yesterday. **GME CLOSED AT $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER\u2019s BREAKEVEN.**\n\nWhat ensued in AH? A back-and-forth teetertotter throughout the entire AH session. Ultimately, every time GME dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.\n\nIn sum, I believe the new baseline price is $124.01. Relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning, I am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending his\/her breakeven price at $124.01. Do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else. They might, but its in their own best interest to hold that line, whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern. Furthermore, think about it yourself, if you dropped a combined $100M in three consecutive days, you must have a contingency plan. It is my belief that this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options. They'll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play.\n\nI would be remissed if I didn't acknowledge there's a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass Ape like us hitting a ballsdeep YOLO play with his entire Trustfund inheritance. But I doubt it.\n\nIn the event my hypothesis checks out, GME is currently sitting at its new support level. This is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity.\n\n# TL;DR.\n\n**I believe the new baseline price for GME is $124.01.** This is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent \\~$104M (\\~$116M if exercised) on call options spanning the last three days, March 1st-March 3rd.\n\nWith that in mind **GME closed yesterday at $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER\u2019s BREAKEVEN.**\n\nTo go further, **every time GME dropped below $124 in the AH session, it hit a springboard** back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.\n\nIt is my belief that **this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets** than what they leveraged out on the options. They'll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play, **which means keeping the price above their $124.01 breakeven.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
        "277":"  \n\nI'm looking for somewhere to blow some steam. I've been navigating how to invest my hard working savings for over two decades, and because of pandemic, as many other people, I saw myself with my savings going down the drain. So, I tried to educate me in how to operate a trading account, and since then I learn how to take my winning and losses gracefully. (mostly losses) Learn how to look charts and try to find the best moment to get into a position I believe is in a good place for swing or long term investment, and not day trade. However, as we all know, market is bearish, and everything goes with it. But looking into the recent events with GameStop, I got myself wondering. Did the big money guys, that have been clearly manipulating the market forever, leaving the average Joe (like myself) to either give them my money (so they can correctly \"manage\" it for me) or they will take it by creating movements that swap your stop loses positions or zero or cash. \n\nThe reason I'm saying that is because just yesterday, some big money guy releases some intel on a company call XL Fleet, saying he is going short on it because he got some insider giving him intel, which leads him to believe the company is not worth the money. Therefore, creating and extreme down movement, which he capitalize on it, because a lot of people just react to information and don't educate themselves before selling or buying, and hurting people that have a honest plan to invest in an apparent good business model. I understand the risks in investing in a fairly new company, but there is no limit to what these guys can put out there? They can say any crap, and then capitalize in people's overreaction? The GameStop saga did not teach anyone anything? \n\nReally disappointing. Not just losing a substantial amount of money, that eventually will correct, but the unnecessary volatility that these \"professionals\" take profits in people's money. \n\nFeel free to educate me more.",

Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?\n\nEdit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??\n\n Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  \u201c dividend news\u201d  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..\n\nSo they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby\n\nMind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \\~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1\/3 of their float because there wasn\u2019t a high demand, the news \u201coddly didnt cover or care about their debut\u201d which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover??

        "281":"Disclaim Not financial advice!\n\nFirst, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.\n\nI see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.\n\nIf we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.\n\nI see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.\n\nFirst, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.\n\nEven they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .\n\nThen let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.\n\nI didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.\n\nSo, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.\n\nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes.\n\nPosition, 104@110\n\nEDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xxz9n4eh9yk61.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d59f77026b9bafba00d7098f4aabc8bea6e8665\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lb2qh7ji9yk61.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ae785774649bb6b53f6f01b7e359a75b4315f8",
        "282":"I am curious to know if I am in the minority or majority on some thoughts I have on the ongoing saga of GME vs. everything else. I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**\n\nFirst full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:\n\n1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.\n2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.\n\n* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO\/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more \"normal\" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO\/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.\n\n3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.\n\n* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.\n\nTL;DR **my opinion**\n\n1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)\n2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD > \"insert ticker\" DD\n3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME\n4. There is no #4, this was a test\n\nAnd that's my two cents.",
        "283":"It\u2019s quite obvious that since January there has been a MASSIVE influx of new members to WSB. As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I\u2019m concerned about how that\u2019s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains\/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.\n\nNowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME.

        "285":"***Edit:*** **Special thanks to the mods for their quick response time in this post's auto-deletion. We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing. Well, I do anyway.**\n\n*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective\/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*\n\nSo I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**\n\nWhy? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.\n\nRyan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nSteam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.\n\nIf they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.\n\nA 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572\/share.\n\nI'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business\/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.\n\nI'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.\n\nLet's fucking go.\n\n***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150\/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***.

He did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store. When people compared Gamestop to Blockbuster, he laughed.\n\nSince Gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention, he has been under a microscope. Billions of dollars see him as the leader, and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for. Everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal, but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons. Given the wave of new hires, I thought now would be a good time to formally discuss the company's mid to long term potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ryan Cohen Vision**\n\nIf you have any money in Gamestop, you better already know this part. That being said, you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again.\n\nRyan Cohen founded Chewy in 2011 and served as the CEO until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3B. This marked the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company and speaks to RC's expertise in e-commerce. This man is the messiah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn 11\/16\/20, Cohen formally wrote a letter to the Gamestop board of directions, detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it. Within it, he discussed:\n\n\\- The growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer\n\n\\- The large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program\n\n\\- Gamestop's unwillingness to change with the times\n\n\\- Gamestop's hardships amid the 'gaming boom'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis letter made it clear that he has a vision for what Gamestop could be, and that he has a plan to get it there. He recently upped his stake from 9-12.91% on 1\/12\/21, which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround. If we have any chance of making it to valhalla, Ryan Cohen will lead us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Draining the swamp**\n\nAs Cohen expressed in his letter, one of the main reasons for Gamestop's fall was its lack of competent leadership. The ship has been sinking for years, and its crew has been suspiciously negligent. While conspiracy theories exist that Gamestop execs tanked the company in an effort to insider trade with hedge funds, we'll keep the tinfoil hats off today.\n\n*Jim Bell- Former CFO*\n\nOn February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Jim Bell, CFO, would be 'resigning'.

GameStop stock is going to the moon regardless, and needs some kind of new shtick to stay relevant. Imagine an ATM machine that buys silver 1oz coins at spot price and sells them for enough of a premium to keep the machines running.\n\nThis will liquify silver, the original money, and should steer us toward eliminating fiat. Physical silver becomes the new savings and cash, and both it and GME go to moontown. I think it's coming, eventually.

        "295":"This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other ~~new investors~~ retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me.\n\n**This is not investment advice**, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a \"day trade\". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.\n\nPattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who \"day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period\", and a day trade is classified as \"the opening and closing of securities on the same day\". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.\n\nFor example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/trading-investing\/trading\/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:\n\n- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.\n\nwhen read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.\n\nI'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.\n\nI have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.\n\nLast thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.\n\nAs for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice).

PC parts and a Streaming Service are certainly possible.\n\nI recommend everyone go back and read (or \"you tube\") the letter RC sent GME back in November to refresh your memories on the vision of this company, in order to fairly evaluate it.\n\n...and I totally fucked up and used the 2019 Gross profit, instead of Net.

Essentially I see them as the potential \"Amazon of Gaming\", having their hands across multiple sectors.\n\nI predict they won't just ease into the market, they will DISRUPT it.\n\nOther competitors playing around in the gaming industry won't be able to compete, there will be massive return from retail investors, whether they previously gamers or not.\n\nOpportunities:\n\n\\-**Hit the ground Running with strategic locations, (In-store Streamed Events??)**\n\n\\-H**yper-growth ecommerce shift**\n\n\\-**Gaming PCs in higher demand.**\n\n\\-C**apture microtransaction market by,**\n\n\\-Large audience shift to Gamestop brand **over** competitors, for same products.\n\n\\-Resurgence of audience demanding of new Gaming Content and Live INTERACTION!!\n\nSo, **at least 1B annual revenue in next 1 to 2 yrs,**\n\nand a, *very conservative*, **30 PE (based on related industry averages weighted by profit estimates by sector).**\n\n...then I gave the whole \"successful rebrand\" thing an **82% chance** of happening (lol idk, take it or leave it).\n\nSo yeah, **$291.85**, super conservative, this would be my floor essentially.\n\nRealistically, I am calculating that GME price should **naturally** hover anywhere from $300-$500, (much potential, wide range) assuming constant number of shares, ofc.\n\n\\*not investment advice, just looking for possible \"fundamentally sound\" number most people, including boomers, would probably accept. \ud83d\ude80",

No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.\n\nIn other words, if take your \ud83d\udca9 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5e\/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.\n\n\"Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit.\" -\/u\/ethandavid\n\nSeriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. \n\nCheck out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https:\/\/www.orlandosentinel.com\/business\/tourism\/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)\n\nA small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*\n\nWatch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.\n\nEven without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. \n\nThe starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to \"increase automation efforts overtime\" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*\n\nIndeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. \n\nYou usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.\n\nThere is a lot of benefit to having at least one \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lxf7y0\/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i\/))\n\nLong puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as \/u\/cyphonismus explained in his DD.\n\nThere is a reason hedgies love it. \n\n**TL:DR** - short SEAS, use premium to buy more GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nObligatory: This is not investment advice. I am not a financial advisor."
